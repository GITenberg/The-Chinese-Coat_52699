      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>leanor MORE walked
      away from the coat. She looked back at it across the glass case of fichus
      and ribbon bows, and went on down the aisle of show-cases to the coats and
      suits at the end. Stewart&rsquo;s was having a sale of coats and suits, and
      Eleanor More was there&mdash;not because she could afford to buy anything,
      even at a sale, but because she was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been passing the store and seen the crowd pressing in through the
      wide doors... She had hesitated a minute and gone in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly six o&rsquo;clock now, and the crowd had thinned. Here and there a
      wandering figure could be seen, half ready for flight, pausing to peck at
      some bargain crumb; and helpers with long gray covers were appearing and
      shrouding the glass cases and counters for the night. The light in the
      shop began to seem gray and a little ghostly; out of it the gold and blue
      colors of the Chinese coat gleamed freshly, like a bit of Oriental flame
      caught in this dull sale of Western goods and held fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More glanced at the coat again&mdash;down through the
      gray-shrouded counters. Then she turned swiftly and went back. It stood by
      itself on its dummy figure at the end of the glass cases; in the fading
      light from a window above, the fantastic gold shadows of the dragons
      chased each other and played hazily across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She halted before it, and half reached out her hand to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman with a large bust and paper cuffs on her sleeves came drifting
      toward her. &ldquo;Anything I can show you, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More looked up. &ldquo;I was looking at this coat.&rdquo; Her hand moved
      vaguely to the dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s eyes followed the gesture. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great bargain!&rdquo; She put out
      her hand to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to slip it on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More drew back. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of buying. I was
      looking. I just happened&mdash;to see it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s hands were busy with the neck of the coat. She slipped it
      deftly from the lay figure and held it up. &ldquo;No harm in trying,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More looked at it and drew away&mdash;and came back. She held out
      her hands with a little laughing gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I cannot afford&mdash;&rdquo; She put her hands into the blue sleeves
      with the quaint trailing ends and drew it up about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman gave a little pat to the shoulders and smiled, pointing to a
      long mirror at the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More moved to the mirror; she stood looking at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind her stretched the gray counters&mdash;shrouded in for the night&rsquo;s
      rest. Only a figure here and there was visible in the distance. Her eyes
      caught the empty spaces behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is late!&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;I am keeping you!&rdquo; She looked over her
      shoulder at the woman who seemed, in the gray light, receding dimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she came forward with a smile. &ldquo;There is no hurry.&rdquo; She touched the
      coat and adjusted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It suits you perfectly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More glanced again into the long mirror. The blue and gold covered
      her from head to foot; and above it, her face looked out at her, a little
      mistily, and smiled to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and the mirrored lady shook her head&mdash;slowly. Then
      they both smiled radiantly and the gold dragons crumpled their tails as
      the coat was flung swiftly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I put it on! I think it bewitched me! Here&mdash;take
      it! Thank you very much.&rdquo; She spoke&mdash;half under her breath, and the
      woman took the coat in her hands. She stood smoothing the folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great bargain&mdash;marked down for to-day.&rdquo; She touched the tag
      with casual finger, and Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes followed the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;It&rsquo;s absurdly cheap&mdash;and very beautiful! But I simply
      cannot afford it! Thank you for showing it to me&mdash;so late!&rdquo; She
      moved, a little blindly, toward the stairs. The elevator had ceased to
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone the woman stood with the coat in her hand irresolute. A
      helper coming by with an armful of gray covers cast a flitting glance at
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want a top?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head. &ldquo;I will put it in the box for to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The helper went on down the aisle. The woman drew a box from beneath the
      counter and folded the dragons with careful hand, and smoothed their tails
      and placed the coat in its box. Through a bit of tissue-paper across the
      top of the blue and gold it gleamed and shimmered softly, and the woman
      brushed light finger-tips across it as she pressed the paper down and
      tucked it in and set the box aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went down the room, and disappeared among the shadows of counters
      and cases, and the shop was left alone. Darkness slipped in from outside,
      and pushed the grayness before it. It clothed the dummy figure in black,
      and descended on the box of dragons, blotting it out. It covered the whole
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness beneath the counter lay the Chinese coat, with its bit of
      tissue-paper lying across the glory of blue and gold, safely tucked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the vast oblongs of windows remained to show faintly, against the
      street outside, where the light came in.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT night she
      dreamed of the coat. She saw its soft folds descending on her out of the
      sky, and she held up her hands to it and caught it to her and wrapped it
      about her and ran in the wind, singing. And all the dragons came alive and
      pranced beside her&mdash;and she threw off the coat and ran with the
      dragons, unclothed. And the freedom of it was like life&mdash;flooding
      down on her out of the sky; and then the dragons moved from her&mdash;they
      were receding into the distance, their great heads held high; and she ran,
      stumbling, after them, alone and naked&mdash;and suddenly she was in a
      crowded street and the people were looking at her, and shame drew about
      her as a vast garment; she shrank back into it, trying to hide&mdash;but
      there was no cover for her&mdash;and she woke with a dry, choking sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got carefully out of bed and tiptoed from the room, closing the door
      behind her. In the next room, she could see the daylight straggling
      through the curtains. She threw up the shades and watched it come. A flush
      of light was in the sky over the mean little houses at the rear; even the
      houses themselves, not yet touched by the light, had a fresh, waiting
      look; and in the chicken-yards the hens ran about busily, pecking at
      something, or nothing. In one of the vacant lots a man was hoeing. His
      bent back had a look of strength. As she watched him, he stopped his work
      a moment and looked up at the sky. Then he went on hoeing, with slow
      strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms were filled with light when she came from her bath; and she
      threw open the windows, and went about getting breakfast with quick steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the plates on the table and paused and went to the door and opened
      it. The little porch outside, half-shaded with vines, was streaked with
      sunshine along the floor. She stepped out on to it, holding out her hand,
      as if to test the warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a table from the wall and brought a cloth for it and laid the
      table for breakfast on the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she looked up. A man in the doorway was surveying her with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came across to him and lifted her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent to kiss it. &ldquo;Up early, weren&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep&mdash;Do you like it&mdash;out here?&rdquo; She waved her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; He surveyed the table. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be beat! Shall I bring things
      out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you might not like it.&rdquo; She poured his coffee. &ldquo;Father never
      liked it&mdash;eating out-of-doors&mdash;at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This</i> is home,&rdquo; said the man. He was sipping his coffee and looking
      contentedly at the vine-shadows on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My other home, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never had any other home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what I <i>called</i> home&mdash;till I knew better!&rdquo; She
      laughed the words at him, and he nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father used to wear his hat&mdash;some days his muffler&mdash;if we tried
      to eat out-of-doors. So we gave it up. I am glad you like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell silent, watching the shadows; and he watched her face. She was
      quiet a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man finished his breakfast&mdash;he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;Nothing very much.&rdquo; She flashed a little
      look at him and got up from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better tell me,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything&mdash;not anything that will ever be&mdash;anything.&rdquo;
       She began to gather up dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made you look pretty happy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it?&rdquo; she laughed out. She stood a moment, looking thoughtfully at the
      vine-shadows on the cloth.... &ldquo;It was a coat I saw at Stewart&rsquo;s, yesterday&mdash;a
      perfectly absurd coat&mdash;for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No coat could be absurd for you&mdash;not if you wanted it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I wanted it&mdash;I suppose.&rdquo; She looked again at the white
      cloth and waited. &ldquo;I think it bewitched me.... It was a Chinese coat, you
      see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her blankly. &ldquo;A Chinese coat&mdash;for <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I told you it was absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; He regarded it thoughtfully. &ldquo;If you want it... But what
      could you <i>do</i> with&mdash;a Chinese coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She was very meek. &ldquo;I just seemed to think&mdash;I
      wanted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t wear it to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;I could wear it to the opera&mdash;if we
      should go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed out. &ldquo;And to the circus!&rdquo; He came around and touched her hair
      where the light fell on it. &ldquo;How much did it cost&mdash;this Chinese
      thingumabob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty dollars&mdash;&rdquo; It came out slowly&mdash;and he whistled softly
      between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the opera!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw out her hands. &ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t mean it! But you asked me&mdash;what
      I was thinking about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did!&rdquo; He was prompt. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll see what we have&mdash;to
      spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved toward the door. &ldquo;Sure you couldn&rsquo;t use it for anything else&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked back over his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;except the opera?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I <i>could</i> make a kimono of it.&rdquo; She glanced at him
      half-pleadingly&mdash;then she laughed out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the old thing! I
      don&rsquo;t know <i>why</i> I told you!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f she thought of
      the coat through the day, there was no sign of it in her face. She went
      about her work with busy, preoccupied look. She did the dishes, and dusted
      and made beds and went to market; and after luncheon, which she had by
      herself on the porch, she lay down, a little while, watching the streaks
      of light that came through the blind-slats and fell across the matting,
      and almost reached to the bed... and when she saw them again, they were
      lying along the pillow close to her&mdash;and it was five o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up with a little exclamation and hurried to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, Richard was late, and everything was ready when he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a happy look about the room,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice home!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and set the dinner on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather! It&rsquo;s been a great day&mdash;&rdquo; He looked at her thoughtfully
      across the table, and took up the carving-knife and tested it gently on
      his thumb. &ldquo;Martin came in&mdash;about the lot, next door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced quickly at him. &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said he&rsquo;s ready&mdash;to sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she gave a little sigh. &ldquo;Well, of course we <i>can&rsquo;t</i>&mdash;But
      it&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, smiling. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer thing! It&rsquo;s just possible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;d been looking things over&mdash;about your Chinese coat,
      you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; Her glance held his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d made up my mind to get it for you&mdash;if it took our
      last
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up a hand. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d just figured out how I could do it&mdash;when
      Martin came in and offered the lot for three hundred&mdash;fifty dollars
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, yesterday, or day before, I should have said&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t
      do it.... But there was the money&mdash;in my hand, practically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give it to him?&rdquo; She leaned forward, a little breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. &ldquo;Do you think I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and came over to her and bent down. &ldquo;It is <i>your</i> Chinese
      coat!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t suppose I was going to mortgage your
      possessions&mdash;without letting you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean I can <i>have</i> it&mdash;the coat!&rdquo; She had clasped her hands&mdash;she
      was gazing at something far beyond him&mdash;far beyond the room, it
      seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her face a minute. &ldquo;You sure can have your coat&mdash;if you
      want it!&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long breath and the light ran back into her face, flooding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;!&rdquo; She threw out her hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it!&mdash;I just
      wanted to be sure I could want it&mdash;if I wanted to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He looked down at her with quiet understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is the lot?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is the lot! Go and eat your dinner, silly boy!&rdquo;

      IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey were not
      likely to forget the night they decided to buy the lot next door. It
      seemed the beginning of married life together. To be sure, they had been
      married nearly a year and they had bought and furnished the house; they
      had even bought a strip of land on the other side of the house that had
      come into the market soon after they were married&mdash;while they still
      had a little money to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in all their purchases before, there had been an element that marked
      them off by themselves. This new purchase was something different&mdash;something
      entered into from choice, and with a free heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called it the Chinese lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Eleanor who named it and told
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughingly. But even to herself it was not a common, every-day
      name. It seemed a kind of dream-place, in a faint, happy light, with
      Chinese dragons chasing across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within twenty-four hours after their decision, the deed for the lot was in
      Richard&rsquo;s pocket; and twenty-four hours later the fence between was torn
      down, and builders were at work on a wall that took in the new lot and
      made the whole place one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More watched the men with shining eyes. When her work was done she
      took her sewing-basket and went into the sunshine across the yard, and
      stepped over the boundary into the new lot. Just beyond the boundary was a
      great oak-tree, with wide branches and great roots bulging out of the
      ground. As she sat down under the tree, she noted the roots; the happy
      thought crossed her mind of children playing there&mdash;each great root a
      playhouse&mdash;with little dishes and mud pies.... Her eyes followed the
      dream, as she unfolded her work and sat sewing, with the light flecking
      down on her and on the root playhouses and green grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More found her there when he came home from work. He went across
      to see how much had been finished on the wall. Then he came back and stood
      and watched her swift needle and the light on her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice place!&rdquo; he said approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I like the roots!&rdquo; She patted one of them beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at it vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but she did not explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ever sit here before?&rdquo; he demanded, looking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The needle paused. &ldquo;Why&mdash;?... We never owned it before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to own it&mdash;to sit on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes I did! Owning it is half the sitting on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself on the ground beside her and looked up into the oak-tree,
      throwing back his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her puzzled eyes regarded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never think of coming out here to sit&mdash;if we didn&rsquo;t own it&mdash;you
      know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah! Just like a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pricked the needle through the muslin in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was the fence,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb over!&rdquo; He had taken a pipe from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached out her hand. &ldquo;Not before dinner!&rdquo; decisively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spoil
      your appetite!&rdquo; She captured the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well!&rdquo; He leaned against the tree and watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was folding her sewing neatly. &ldquo;I should <i>never</i> have climbed
      over!&rdquo; She pinned the work together in a compact roll and nodded to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have gone round&mdash;&rdquo; he said with a teasing note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean, Dick! I shouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to sit under a tree
      that did not belong to us&mdash;and that belonged to the Martins or to the
      Suttons, or to anybody&mdash;and not in our own yard&mdash;nobody would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny idea!&rdquo; said Dick slowly. &ldquo;Same tree, same place, just Ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him. &ldquo;Help me up! It&rsquo;s time for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strolled across the grass beside her to the house, and helped set the
      table while she was in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not smoke his pipe. She had laid it on a high shelf over the mantel
      as she came in. She had to climb on a chair to reach the mantel. Dick
      could have reached it with one lift of his hand. But he only eyed it,
      half-humorously, as he set out doilies and finger-bowls and counted
      spoons, and called out to the kitchen to know how many forks were needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for worlds would he have taken down the pipe&mdash;not for a single
      whiff. He had a kind of savage pleasure in it&mdash;watching it up there&mdash;with
      its old familiar brown bowl turned to the wall.... Time had been when that
      pipe was his only friend.... He did not own a house and lot then&mdash;and
      an oak-tree....
    </p>
    <p>
      He peeped out of the window at the tree, serene in the evening light....
      Suddenly he saw a Chinese Coat&mdash;blue and gold, she had said it was;
      and the happiness in his face deepened. He whistled softly between his
      teeth as he arranged forks and spoons.... &ldquo;<i>Our</i> forks and spoons!&rdquo;
       he said&mdash;and laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to the door. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;my dear&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; and she returned to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More had not married until he was thirty-five. Eleanor was
      twenty-six. It had not been easy to win her. She had her tutoring to
      do.... He took her away from her home town&mdash;into his kitchen. But he
      knew she was happy&mdash;far happier than she had been in her little world
      that looked up to her.... As for himself, he felt as if he moved in a new
      world&mdash;a great world that stretched through leagues&mdash;to the moon&mdash;or
      the sun.... The pipe-dreams of old days seemed like hen-coop dreams in the
      spaces in Eleanor&rsquo;s mind. Each day he began exploration anew; and each
      day, in the little circle of her being, he seemed to sweep out into the
      world&mdash;great cosmic paths, and tracks of stars and shining spaces....
    </p>
    <p>
      She came from the kitchen, smoothing down the sleeves of her gown and
      casting a last look at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too many forks!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She removed one from each plate, and put it back in its place&mdash;neatly
      in its compartment in the drawer of the shining sideboard.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> MONTH later he
      hurried home one day from work. It was Saturday noon, and a half-holiday
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was finishing her luncheon. The light in the half-darkened dining-room
      seemed to him mysterious and cool as he came in from the street outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up in surprise. &ldquo;You are home early!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her plate. &ldquo;Through luncheon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost&mdash;Do you want something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve had mine&mdash;Let&rsquo;s go off somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes she was ready and they left the house. He tucked the key in
      his vest pocket and they hurried across the lawn to catch an outgoing car.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed the oak-tree he glanced at it with a knowing smile. He might
      almost have been said to wag his head at it. And he patted the pocket
      where the key lay.... Close beside the key were five round golden disks&mdash;little
      yellow disks that might at any minute turn into great gold dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the car at a fork in the road and were in the open country; they
      climbed a high hill, and a hill behind the high hill, and came out at last
      upon a bluff overlooking miles of country.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her hat and sat down with a happy sigh, lifting her face to
      the breeze that came across the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, without speaking. His eyes were on the mountains in the
      distance. His heart was talking to five gold coins that lay just over it
      and caused it to beat in a jolly happy rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out a hand and touched hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something nice has happened today!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this is pretty nice!&rdquo; Her hand swept all the reach of space about
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; he said teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something we want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. More than anything in the world,&rdquo; he said after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes on him gravely. She looked at him a full minute. &ldquo;How
      do you know that?&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He moved nearer to her, and they watched the light change and
      sweep in great shadows across the fields below. &ldquo;You want it&mdash;more
      than anything in the world,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly. &ldquo;I knew you did&mdash;when
      I took it for the lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted the hand that lay beside her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want it&mdash;not so <i>very</i> much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anyway, I
      wanted the lot more.... And, besides, I&rsquo;ve been so busy getting ready for
      Annabel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting ready for William Archer,&rdquo; he corrected gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting ready for Annabel&mdash;&rdquo; she pursued, &ldquo;that I have not had time
      to think about things&mdash;just things for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not just for yourself&mdash;it is for me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned a startled, half-questioning look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded gayly, watching her face. &ldquo;Did you think <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t want
      that Chinese coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you?&rdquo; Her face had flushed like a child&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I thought I was&mdash;just
      silly about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were. That&rsquo;s why I wanted it for you.... But, of course, it was
      sensible to get the lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Her assent was wholehearted and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now we&rsquo;re going to get the coat, too&mdash;to-day. I had some money
      come in&rdquo;&mdash;he patted his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be gone&mdash;!&rdquo; she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so. I sent over word. They&rsquo;ve got a Chinese coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>hope</i> it is the same one&mdash;!&rdquo; She breathed a happy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to go right away!&rdquo; She started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough.&rdquo; He spoke lazily. &ldquo;I told them to hold it&mdash;till five
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; He took out his watch. &ldquo;Two hours. Plenty of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank back. Presently she looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
&ldquo;I never guessed how much I wanted it! I did not know!"&mdash;after a little pause&mdash;"I think I did not let myself know.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
Then they talked for a while about Annabel--whose name was William
Archer, he pointed out to her....
</p>
    <p>
And they laid plans that ran far ahead
into the future&mdash;almost till Annabel was an old lady and lonely&mdash;only
she would have married by that time--and there would be other
Annabels.... It seemed to stretch away infinitely.
 </p>
    <p>
It was all wonderful&mdash;and mysterious. She turned and buried her face in
the moss for a long time and was very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> And overhead a great bird passed by. Richard watched the circling
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She patted her hair and began to pin on her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her, smiling gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we will go and buy the coat,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;that wonderful Chinese
      coat&mdash;blue and gold, I think you said, my dear&mdash;with the great
      gold dragons on it!&rdquo;

      the store he became aware that she was deeply excited; there was a little
      flush in her face, and she walked with quickened step. He laid his hand on
      her arm protectingly. But she did not slow her pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of time,&rdquo; he said softly in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only gave him a sidelong glance and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be the one!&rdquo; she murmured as they entered the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll hunt till we find one like it!&rdquo; he replied valiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the elevator grills she recognized the woman who had waited on her
      before, and she went swiftly toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come to see the coat,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at her, almost in pity, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another party interested in the coat&mdash;You mean the Chinese
      coat, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor&rsquo;s face was blank. There was a little catch in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman reached down a hand beneath the counter. &ldquo;We promised to hold it&mdash;&rdquo;
       She glanced at the clock, and drew out a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other party said he was pretty sure to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the tissue-paper a maze of blue and gold showed dimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the paper, throwing it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m the other party,&rdquo; said Richard More. He stooped forward,
      smiling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are!&rdquo; said Eleanor with a breath of relief. &ldquo;Of course you
      are&mdash;the &rsquo;other party&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the woman. &ldquo;It was my husband wanted to see it,&rdquo; she said
      almost proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman consulted a slip of paper. &ldquo;Name of &rsquo;More&rsquo;.&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman lifted the garment from the box and flung it wide on the counter
      before them; and all the color in it glowed softly and the colors that lay
      on the counter about it glared and seemed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty thing!&rdquo; said Richard More. He pulled his mustache a little
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman lifted the coat and shook it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let madam try it on,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came from behind the counter and placed it on Eleanor&rsquo;s shoulders,
      smoothing the folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a usual garment&mdash;Not every one could wear a garment like
      that.&rdquo; She moved back a little, gazing with half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It suits madam perfectly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband surveyed it. &ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor turned and moved from him down the cleared space to the mirror.
      And he was conscious of something remote in her movements. She seemed to
      withdraw, to hold herself removed, wrapped in the blue and gold folds of
      the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved after her and she turned and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he said approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He half put out his hand to touch an end of blue sleeve that trailed away
      to a tasselled cord.... Then he withdrew his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he
      repeated vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk came forward and lifted the tassel and let it fall in place; her
      fingers sprayed over the garment in an easy, official way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo; asked Richard More.
    </p>
    <p>
      She consulted the tag hanging on a bit of gold cord in front. She dropped
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ninety-five dollars,&rdquo; she said indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stooped to arrange a fold of the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More turned a little. She seemed to gaze down with wide,
      reproachful eyes at the woman&rsquo;s bent form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband&rsquo;s tone was crisp. &ldquo;We understood the price was&mdash;less than
      that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman straightened herself and looked at him. &ldquo;That was last month&mdash;for
      the sale. It was marked down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s marked up, is it?&rdquo; he asked a little cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented and touched the coat gently with her fingers, stroking it.
      &ldquo;It is a coat Mr. Stewart bought himself,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;in China. He
      found it when he was buying goods&mdash;and liked it. But we&rsquo;ve had it in
      stock some time, and he told me to mark it down for the sale. After that,
      when no one bought it&rdquo;&mdash;she seemed to look at Eleanor almost with
      reproachful eyes&mdash;&ldquo;then he told me to put back the original price....
      It&rsquo;s more than worth it, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Richard absently. He was wondering how much Eleanor
      really wanted the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not spoken from the moment it was laid on her shoulders. She
      seemed to have withdrawn into it&mdash;to have become an inaccessible part
      of its mystery and charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not expected&mdash;to pay more than fifty dollars,&rdquo; said Richard
      More slowly. &ldquo;I happen to have that amount with me&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman waited on the suggestion.... She looked at the two people before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Mr. Stewart&mdash;if he hasn&rsquo;t gone. It&rsquo;s not like regular
      stock. I don&rsquo;t know whether he would sell it for less&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved away from them down the store and they stood, with all the dummy
      figures standing around, and waited for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More did not speak. He longed to ask his wife whether she wanted
      it as much as that&mdash;as much as ninety-five dollars. But he could not
      shape the words that would say it. He almost wondered whether she would
      understand&mdash;if he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her hands hanging idle and her eyes looking down. She was
      like a prehistoric creature&mdash;an Oriental Madonna of ageless form and
      beauty.... Almost, he fancied, there were tears in the lidded eyes.... He
      started and turned brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk was coming back. He looked at her keenly as she came toward
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Ninety-five dollars,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you can have a
      charge, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand moved to his pocket and his eyes were on his wife&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, with a shiver of the long silken lines, and she threw back the
      coat with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd, Richard I&mdash;We can&rsquo;t pay all that money&mdash;for a
      whim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand stayed itself from the pocket. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want it?&rdquo; he asked
      doubt-ingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; She shook the coat from her and stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman caught it with a quick gesture as it fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand waited, fingering the coins in his pocket. &ldquo;I think we could
      manage it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;! I don&rsquo;t want it!&rdquo; She ignored the woman. She moved swiftly
      past her and was half-way to the elevator. He sprang after her, with a
      backward glance of apology at the woman, who stood with the coat on her
      arm, gazing after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the elevator Eleanor shivered a little, and he squeezed her arm in his
      in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he said soothingly, beneath his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and pressed a little against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they stepped into the light he glanced at her face. It had almost a
      tragic look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better go back and get it,&rdquo; he said peremptorily. &ldquo;Hang the price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way to the door, he touched her arm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it!&rdquo; he said
      coax-ingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t want it!</i>&rdquo; She turned a gaze on him&mdash;half-tragic,
      half-humorous.... &ldquo;Do you know why I would not get it?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything!&rdquo; he declared, jostling through the crowd to keep
      pace with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m incapable of knowing&mdash;<i>anything!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled&mdash;a little wistful smile&mdash;up at him. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t get
      it.... Can you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I can hear you.&rdquo; He bent his head to her, and they moved as a unit
      through the crowd. &ldquo;I can hear you. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought suddenly&rdquo;&mdash;she gasped a little&mdash;&ldquo;how <i>awful</i> it
      would be if Annabel should ever want to have clothes&mdash;things to wear&mdash;as
      badly as I wanted that coat&mdash;and all those dear little beasts winding
      around on it!... It wasn&rsquo;t a coat!&rdquo; Her lips were close to his ear, a
      little smile seemed to run from them to him, and he laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a coat!&rdquo; she said fiercely. &ldquo;It was a blue and gold temptation&mdash;with
      dragons! I wouldn&rsquo;t have it&mdash;at any price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for fifty dollars?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;and he bent a keen look at her
      unconscious face in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if they would give it to me!&rdquo; she said with swift decision. &ldquo;I want
      Annabel to be mild in her nature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard More followed her. Privately he fancied that Annabel would be a
      person who would know her own mind. If she wanted a blue and gold coat,
      she would have it, he thought; and if she didn&rsquo;t want a blue and gold
      coat, she wouldn&rsquo;t have it, he thought.... And William Archer&mdash;? Well&mdash;blue
      and gold were not exactly colors to be desired in the case of William
      Archer. In any case Annabel and William Archer must look out for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going back to-morrow, or the first chance he could, and buy that
      Chinese coat for his wife. He wanted it for her.... As they made their way
      out of the store, he saw it again, wrapped about her, and he saw the
      down-bent face with its look of mystery, rising above the shimmering
      folds.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>he seemed to have
      brought away with her some secret of the coat&mdash;a touch of its mystery
      and charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard watched her as she went about the house, occupied with little
      things. He fancied there was a look in her face that came and went
      shadowily&mdash;as if the curtains before a hidden place were swept aside
      by an unseen wind.... And before he could look again&mdash;it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face in repose was very common-place, he knew; it had grown a little
      full and there was a humorous, almost conceited, little upward twist to
      the mouth, that he found annoying.... And then suddenly, when she was off
      guard, the look had fled and he was gazing at the strange face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself growing troubled, driven by a force he did not quite
      comprehend&mdash;a disbelief in the solid earth and the turning of the
      seasons.... He had sown grass-seed in the new lot; the wall was finished
      and vines had been planted at its base. But the lot had to his eyes an
      unsubstantial look. He had an almost superstitious feeling that it had
      been bought with a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone back for the Chinese coat the Monday morning after they were
      there. He was waiting at the door when the store opened and he hurried
      directly to the first floor, too impatient to wait for the elevator to
      make its trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman saw him coming. She stopped her work and waited.... He fancied
      her look was a little startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her he would take the coat. He would pay part on it and have the
      rest charged&mdash;he would take it with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little he grasped the fact that the coat was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we were here late! There was no one else.... You had no <i>chance</i>
      to sell it!&rdquo; He could have believed she was lying to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her face was open&mdash;and there was unmistakable regret in her
      voice. &ldquo;I would have reserved it for you with pleasure over Sunday, or
      longer&mdash;if you had told me.... I thought your wife did not care for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she may have thought the price was a little steep,&rdquo; he
      admitted. &ldquo;But I wanted her to have it&mdash;I intended she should have
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. A woman came&mdash;not two minutes after you left&mdash;I
      still had the coat on my arm. She must have been in the elevator that came
      up as you went down.... And the minute she saw the coat she stopped. She
      seemed to know she wanted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried it on her right there where we stood, and she bought it and paid
      for it and took it away.... I don&rsquo;t think she meant to buy a coat when she
      came up. She was looking for something else, I think, and happened to see
      the coat and took a fancy to it and bought it. I&rsquo;m sorry you did not tell
      me to save it.... It was much more becoming to your wife. It really seemed
      made for your wife.&rdquo; Her voice was full of interest and a gentle kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no customers in the store; he felt as if he and the woman were
      alone in a vast place. She was not a mere clerk. She seemed linked with
      the coat and its destiny, and with their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her and went away. And the next day he went again to see if
      they could get him a duplicate of the coat&mdash;if he left an order.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him tolerantly. &ldquo;A coat like that,&rdquo; her glance seemed to
      say, &ldquo;is to be taken when you have the chance&mdash;and not be coming back
      for duplicate orders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was not a chance in a thousand,&rdquo; she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your order, of course, and I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Stewart. But they
      don&rsquo;t make those coats by the dozen; and, besides, it is very, very old&mdash;hundreds
      of years, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; He groaned a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to see all the mysterious color of the coat and the shimmer of
      its folds&mdash;and the look in Eleanor&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I hope you can get
      something like it for us,&rdquo; he said inanely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone back to inquire again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had his address; they were to send him word if they found anything.
      Mr. Stewart was to make a trip to the East very soon. She would send him
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was left at that. They would send him word.... He planned, in the back
      of his mind, to buy the coat for Eleanor but not to give it to her&mdash;not
      just yet. He would buy it, he thought, and put it away; and when William
      Archer arrived, he would bring it out and throw it about her shoulders. He
      liked to fancy her in it and to think how it would help her disappointment
      about Annabel.... She could enjoy it to the full. She would not be afraid
      of injuring Annabel or her morals&mdash;when William Archer was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no word came and the months slipped by.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEN, one evening,
      Richard More came home from the office and found a new look in his house.
      He knew it, even before he caught a glimpse of a nurse&rsquo;s white cap
      hurrying through the lower hall and before the doctor met him at the foot
      of the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just going,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going&mdash;?&rdquo; Richard caught himself. &ldquo;Has it come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled at him&mdash;at the ignorance and youthful credulity of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back in an hour or two. Everything is going splendidly. Your
      wife has courage!&rdquo; And he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage&mdash;Eleanor? Of course she had courage! She was made of it.
      What did the doctor know about Eleanor&rsquo;s courage?&rdquo; He hurried up the
      stairs... the fleeting sense of life in his quick steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him with the little upward twist of her lip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
      right, Dickie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no mystery, no courage&mdash;only Eleanor&rsquo;s competent look as if
      there were dusting to be done, and men-folks were better out of the
      way.... And yet, behind it, he had a sense that she withdrew to some high
      place, to a remote, inaccessible cliff, and looked down on him with wide
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered miserably about the house; a part of the night he slept, and
      part of it he spent at the telephone, sending orders for the doctor and
      nurse, and answering the door-bell when the response came.... All through
      the early hours he longed fiercely for the arrival of William Archer.
      Then, as the night went on, he lost interest in William Archer and his
      coming, and would have welcomed Annabel.... And he cast aside even the
      thought of Annabel. He longed only for an end to the misery.... And when
      at last the doctor said in businesslike tones, &ldquo;A fine girl, Mr. More!&rdquo; he
      only blinked at him, and his tousled hair took on a more rebellious twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine girl! What of it!... What had girls to do with this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine girl&rdquo; did not connect herself, in any vague way, with Annabel or
      with life.... Probably a new girl for the kitchen....! Well, they needed a
      girl! They needed a dozen girls!
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered out miserably&mdash;and the doctor followed him with a quick
      look and something in a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, drink this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Richard drank it&mdash;and looked at him stupidly. Something was
      happening inside his brain&mdash;things were growing more settled and
      luminous. A smile wreathed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl, is it?&rdquo; he cried jubilantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More clapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor removed the shoulder gently. He turned toward Eleanor&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay outside,&rdquo; he said as he disappeared. &ldquo;We shall not need you
      for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Richard sat down in his parlor on the small sofa and took his tousled
      head in his hands and held it fast. He may have dozed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got up and straggled to the kitchen, he found a strange woman
      making a fire in the range.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had finished polishing off the top of the range and held a black cloth
      in her hand. The hand was very black, he noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to her and went past her to the door and opened it. The world
      looked very fresh. The earth and the grass on either side the path were
      very dark and moist&mdash;as if they had been dipped in some curious
      fluid, and the sky had a kind of luminous quality&mdash;swelling with
      fulness and a freshness of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More looked up at it and drew in a deep breath&mdash;and with the
      intake he understood, for the first time, that all men see the earth
      new-washed one morning in their lives. He had a sense of kinship with the
      earth and with every one living on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned back to the kitchen, the woman was putting the black cloth
      under the sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl!&rdquo; he said. He tried in vain to keep the morning out of his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be to God!&rdquo; said the woman. She turned promptly and straightened
      her back and beamed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to her and grasped the blackened one. He did not
      suspect how many young fathers had shaken hands with cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      His experience was unique. He looked about the kitchen with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen Murphy brought some broth and put it on the gas-range.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her with kindling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been familiar with his kitchen before. But it had not looked to him
      just as it looked now.... That broth she was heating was for <i>his wife</i>...
      to keep her alive. He looked at a row of saucepans with intelligent gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen Murphy tested the broth and went from the room, carrying it with
      careful hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her disappear and looked about the homelike room.... She was
      going to feed Eleanor. Just outside the door was the ice-box, where he had
      blundered in the night, breaking up the ice, crushing it for the doctor&mdash;they
      had told him to hurry&mdash;hurry!... Ages ago it seemed. And now Eleanor
      was to have her broth. She was being fed.... Those stew-pans over there
      were for her. Somehow out of this kitchen, she was to be fed, his baby was
      being fed&mdash;they were all being fed!

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e thrust his hands
      into his pockets and strolled down the back path to the chicken-yard. He
      peered through the wire at the strutting fowls. His hair was tousled,
      there were red rims about his eyes&mdash;and he had never felt so alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chicken-yard was close to the back fence; on the other side of the
      fence were chicken-yards that belonged to the houses at the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very common people in the houses at the rear. And the houses
      themselves, facing on the parallel street, were unsightly and small.
      Richard had taken pains to have no relations with the houses in the rear.
      He had an instinctive sense that it might lead to complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was at work in the yard across the fence, digging a post-hole.
      Richard&rsquo;s eye fell on him. He came nearer to the fence and leaned on it
      and looked over. The man looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard nodded. &ldquo;Fine morning!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded a reply, and shifted his pipe in his teeth and thrust his
      shovel into the ground. His back was very broad, Richard noticed. There
      was something mighty in the swing of the great shoulders as they flung up
      the earth out of the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard watched a minute in silence. The man paused and wiped his forehead
      with the back of his hand. He spit casually on his palms and took up the
      shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s voice halted him and he put down the shovel and came over to the
      fence. Richard smiled a little awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to stop your work. I was wondering what you were going to
      put there.&rdquo; He indicated the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s face was broad, and a little stupid. It stared at Richard. Then
      it looked at the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new run I&rsquo;m making for the hens. The old one&rsquo;s dusty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!... You&rsquo;ve got a fine lot of birds!&rdquo; Richard waved a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good!&rdquo; The man eyed them with slow pride. &ldquo;Got nine eggs
      yesterday,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great morning!&rdquo; responded Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s gaze lifted itself to the clear, fresh-washed sky, and came back
      and rested on the oak-tree across the lot. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve</i> got a pretty
      place&mdash;nice tree over there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard wheeled and faced it. &ldquo;I bought that tree last spring&mdash;needed
      more room&mdash;for the children&mdash;to play.&rdquo; He spoke with offhand
      fatherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got children?&rdquo; said the man. His voice was astonished and a little
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;A little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded pleasantly. &ldquo;I never saw her playing round,&rdquo; he said
      simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;well... She was born this morning!&rdquo; Richard laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled at him a slow, deep smile.... And all his face changed in
      the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man now!&rdquo; he added after a minute. The rough face grew quiet and
      strong. And Richard had a sense of something human that stirred in him.
      This man digging a post-hole had known!
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood a minute in silence, looking about them at the morning and the
      free space of sky and watching the sun that had come over the roofs of the
      shabby houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It shone full in Richard&rsquo;s eyes. He turned abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go in for breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man spat absently on the ground and went back to his shovelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chicken-yard the hens scuttled about, picking up chaff and bits of
      grain out of the dust. Over in the corner of Richard More&rsquo;s yard stood the
      great oak-tree spreading its branches wide; and in the lot at the rear the
      stolid, unkempt man lifted his shovel and thrust it into the ground and
      threw out a handful of earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      As Richard went up the path, he glanced at the house&mdash;The blinds of
      the upper window to the east were being drawn carefully together.... She
      was lying there in the shaded room. She would be sleeping now.... And
      suddenly he saw her in the blue coat, as if she lay wrapped in its folds&mdash;in
      her slumber. He had a sense of loss&mdash;that he had not given it to
      her.... Perhaps he should never be able to give it to her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the oak-tree, standing majestic in the lot across the lawn
      with its great gnarled roots protruding from the ground. And as he went up
      the path he had a sudden blind sense, almost of anger, at the oak-tree and
      its strength.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he thing that
      surprised Richard most was the ease and efficiency with which Eleanor
      handled Annabel&mdash;she seemed to know by instinct things that Richard
      could not understand&mdash;and that he could not understand how she came
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she reached out her hands to take Annabel, her fingers seemed, of
      themselves, to curve into the places where they would fit into the
      spineless bundle and give it support. If Richard tried to take up the
      bundle, his fingers fell away like the legs of the brittle crab and the
      bundle collapsed, incalculable and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo; he would say. And he would right Annabel and try to
      still her protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Eleanor would only smile gently, and send him on some masculine errand
      while she soothed Annabel&rsquo;s feelings in the proper way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had once watched a cat with her kittens and he had a vivid sense
      of the kinship of method&mdash;so had kittens always been brought into the
      world and tended; so they would always be&mdash;likewise babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not something that could be read in a book or taught in a
      school.... Eleanor grew very beautiful these days. The little upward twist
      left her mouth; and if it grew almost too knowing in its sense of the
      boundless and accumulated wisdom of ages as regards babies&mdash;that,
      Richard decided, was Annabel&rsquo;s fault.... Really, to know how to manage a
      little handful like Annabel might make any one proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one thing, Annabel knew exactly what she wanted.... And she usually
      got it. She was often disciplined on the way to it, and thwarted&mdash;but
      in the end she got what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Richard More watched Annabel&rsquo;s progress through life, he thought more
      than once of the regal gesture with which Annabel&rsquo;s mother had thrown back
      the Chinese coat and cast it aside for Annabel&rsquo;s sake....
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he saw Annabel! Life was often very puzzling. But Richard More had
      not time to spend working it out. He was too prosperous to puzzle.
      Whatever he put his hand to seemed to flourish. Men came to have faith in
      his ventures, and to watch for his investments as pointers to success. His
      business increased and his family increased.... William Archer came in due
      season, and then Claude, and then Martin, and Christine, and that was the
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children grew up healthy and normal, except Claude. There seemed some
      obscure trouble with the boy, and before he was six years old it had
      declared itself. Within a year, in spite of expensive doctors and care, he
      died. That had been their first and their only real sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when they came back to the house from the funeral that he told
      Eleanor of his second attempt to get the coat for her.... They were alone
      in the house. The children had been sent away during the child&rsquo;s illness
      and had not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fancied Eleanor drooped a little as they came into the house; and his
      mind went out for something to comfort her.... It encountered the Chinese
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as they sat together in the house that seemed so curiously desolate
      and different from their usual life together, he told her of the morning
      he went back to Stewart&rsquo;s and of his disappointment, and of how he had
      never quite given up hope that some day Stewart would send for him and
      tell him to come and get the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened with wide, set eyes&mdash;almost like a child to a
      fairy-tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very dear of you, Richard!&rdquo; she said. And she smiled to him,
      almost as she smiled to the children, and he felt the quick tears in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly she had thrown herself in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick, I am so lonely!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was the way she came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, although she still guided the children and her hand was on the
      helm in all decisions, it was to Richard she turned for assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come apparently to uncharted waters, and she did not try to make
      soundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Richard More was as puzzled by her reliance on him as he had been by
      her wisdom with babies and with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to him that in her reliance, too, there might be a kind
      of wisdom&mdash;not to be expounded by logic, perhaps&mdash;but deep as
      life.... For himself, he knew that he had not wisdom to advise any one. He
      simply did what he could&mdash;and when his advice prospered, he was as
      naively and proudly surprised as any one.

      XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE children were
      brought up in the oak-tree. Richard made a cradle-box at the end of one of
      the low boughs that almost swept the ground and there was always one baby
      in the box on the bough and one on the ground among the roots&mdash;a new
      one that had just come down from the bough.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, presently, one of those on the ground&mdash;with the help of
      Eleanor and a chair&mdash;climbed to the first branches close to the
      trunk.... Then another one climbed, and another, till they were all
      swarming in the great oak&mdash;no longer close to the trunk, but far out
      on the branches among the leaves, swinging and lilting in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys played they were sailors climbing the masts that swayed giddily
      beneath them; they sat on cross-beams and gazed out to sea; or they were
      on the scaffolding of tall buildings, hammering great steel beams into
      place as the sky-scrapers rose in the air; or they were the advance force
      of an army&mdash;scouting aeroplanes, swooping toward a besieged town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the branches of the great tree and the wind that swayed them or
      drove shrilly against them, the boys adventured on life. But Annabel made
      of the tree an outdoor home as like the one across the lawn as the leaves
      and branches and a great trunk shooting up through the centre would
      permit. The tree-trunk was the chimney, of course, and she had roaring
      fires in every room, up stairs and down, and cooking and sweeping and
      dusting, with lively flourishes and much running up and down stairs. She
      was a little lonely at times, because the boys&mdash;who did not really
      care for the game&mdash;would suddenly desert her for excursions in the
      aeroplanes, or to shoot arrows from the house-top. She was liable to find
      herself, at any moment, with her house swept and dusted, and no one to
      live in it with her. Only down from the top among the leaves and the
      swaying limbs would come wild growls and quick whispers&mdash;intent and
      breathless calls to action.... Then Annabel would leave her dust-cloths
      and her pots and pans, and creep stealthily up, up, up&mdash;till the
      topmost branch was reached, and the wind blew in her face, and her little
      pigtails stood straight out with delight and she was filled with the glow
      of life. For days she would play the game in the top of the tree. And
      then, some morning, she would find herself back among her treasures&mdash;her
      sticks and bits of moss and leaves, close to the trunk of the tree, going
      up and down stairs in happy content; and her imagination would grow deep
      and intent. Her face, pressed against the bark, seemed no longer to need
      the swing of the dangerous branches and the surging of the wind to rouse
      it. She would sit close to the trunk of the tree on a solid limb, and play
      the great game almost without stirring&mdash;a deep silent game that
      stirred her to the very core.... The boys were willing to play house with
      her and sometimes to sweep and dust a little along the branches, and visit
      back and forth, upstairs and down. But as for sitting on a limb, intent
      and still, gazing at what went on beneath the line of sight!... They left
      her sitting there alone, gazing at nothing, and fled to the top of the
      tree and yelled with shrill vacant calls of delight and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the youngest baby, who proved happily to be a girl, when the time
      for climbing came&mdash;when this youngest baby had been pulled and
      boosted by Annabel up into the tree beside her, and when two of them could
      sit happily side by side, looking at each other in silence, then there
      seemed a fairer division of forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the boys, when they ventured far out on dangerous limbs, would
      feel a silent tug pulling them back to the heart of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And underneath the tree where the children played, Eleanor sat with her
      sewing or reading or with the youngest baby on her lap, and sang to it or
      played with it till it was time for it to sleep in its cradle-box in the
      tree....
    </p>
    <p>
      And Richard coming home at night, or at noon on half-holidays, would find
      his family there, and he would climb with the boys, or sit with Eleanor
      under the tree, or play with the youngest baby. Or he would stroll with
      his pipe back and forth across the lawn, puffing it and listening to the
      voices that came from the tree, or watch his wife, with the sunlight and
      the shadow-leaves falling on her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he took them all for excursions into the country&mdash;at first
      in street-cars, crowding and piling in; and then in the old surrey that
      was big enough to carry them all; and at last in the touring-car that
      swept up the miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no pause in his prosperity; though the tax of the growing family
      made it a little difficult sometimes to adjust business and family
      demands.... And then suddenly the money began to come in and pile up
      faster than he could use it. He was counted one of the solid men of the
      region; and the family life expanded on all sides. The problem now was not
      whether the business could afford it, but whether the children&rsquo;s
      characters could afford it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Eleanor sought for expensive schools that would force a child
      to live simply and fare hard and think keen and straight; and when no such
      schools were to be found, Richard took William Archer out of the expensive
      school that was making a nonentity of him, and put him into the business
      and drove him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Annabel was brought home on the plea that her mother needed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not quite strong that year, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Annabel took charge of the house&mdash;and of Eleanor and Richard, and
      of every one in sight.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT Annabel knew
      her own mind, there was no question; and that Annabel also knew her
      mother&rsquo;s mind, there was no question in Annabel&rsquo;s mind.... She was not
      perhaps altogether responsible for this feeling about her mother. It would
      have taken a more astute person than Annabel to discover that all that
      went on underneath Eleanor More&rsquo;s quiet look was not open for the world to
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel loved her mother and trusted her; and to the best of her ability
      she took care of her&mdash;though she knew, with a kind of fierce pity,
      that her mother could never be of her own generation, and that she could
      not know the real nature of the plans and visions that swept before that
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a suffragist!&rdquo; she announced one day in swift assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Eleanor More looked up with a quiet smile. &ldquo;I am one, too,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel stared at her a minute. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were&mdash;a
      suffragist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked at her with slow suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what a suffragist is, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Eleanor went on with her sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I Well.... am going to march&mdash;in the procession!&rdquo; She was
      watching her mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is the procession?&rdquo; There was a little upward twist to Eleanor&rsquo;s lip
      that might have been amusement at her position, or dismay. &ldquo;When did you
      say the procession is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week&mdash;Monday.... You going to march?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Eleanor threaded her needle and drew in the end and twisted it into
      a skilful knot. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think I shall march.&rdquo; It was quite casual,
      and she inspected her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;!&rdquo; Annabel turned it in her mind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get a short
      skirt&mdash;if you are going to march. You haven&rsquo;t a thing that clears the
      mud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Annabel had out her mother&rsquo;s wardrobe and turned and planned, and had a
      woman in to shorten a skirt for her. And all the days before the parade,
      she watched her solicitously, and waited on her&mdash;as if she were an
      invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to have you march in that old parade!&rdquo; she exclaimed almost
      viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you do.... But I mind it for you!&rdquo; She rumpled her hair,
      with a quick gesture, like a boy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea what they&rsquo;ll do. They
      may throw sticks at you, or&mdash;eggs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you, it won&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo; said Eleanor placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel stared at her. Then she smiled. She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the same thing,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You little know&mdash;how much
      it isn&rsquo;t the same thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, the parade was not so terrible. They assembled quietly,
      and with importance, at the city hall and marched through the principal
      streets, and had speeches; and Eleanor and Annabel marched side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Annabel was so busy guarding her mother from unpleasant experiences,
      and looking after her comfort, and providing places for her to sit down
      when the procession stopped a minute, that she quite forgot to have
      experiences of her own or to be thrilled or frightened at her temerity, or
      any of the exciting things that her imagination had cast beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it a rather tame performance!&rdquo; she declared at dinner that night,
      after it was over, &ldquo;&mdash;a rather tame performance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Richard, who had stood on the sidewalk and watched his wife and
      daughter march past, with a little amused smile, nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a mistake taking your mother, perhaps?&rdquo; he suggested mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel cast a quick glance at her mother&rsquo;s unperturbed face, and her look
      lightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s a sport!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take her! She took herself!&rdquo;
       She was silent a minute.... Then&mdash;slowly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have backed out the last minute, you know&mdash;if mother hadn&rsquo;t
      been so set on going!&rdquo; She looked at her meditatively. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell
      what mother will do!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;She does the queerest things&mdash;queer
      for <i>her</i>, I mean!&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next week
      Annabel became flitting in her movements. She began to take an interest in
      her clothes, and evolved dainty, distracting gowns that made her piquant
      face almost beautiful. And she multiplied new ways of doing her hair&mdash;a
      new way for each new hat&mdash;till William Archer declared she might as
      well be a week-end visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; she demanded. She turned her head for inspection. She
      had come down to luncheon in a new hat that defied description.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Archer surveyed it. &ldquo;Well&mdash;it&rsquo;s different! I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s
      my idea of a suffragist hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a suffragist,&rdquo; said Annabel calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long since?&rdquo; asked William Archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;quite a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor was looking on with a little, amused smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turncoat!&rdquo; said William Archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.... I&rsquo;d rather be a turncoat than a&mdash;frump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are&mdash;most of them&mdash;!&rdquo; said Annabel viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Annabel&mdash;!&rdquo; It was Eleanor&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Some of the nicest women
      are suffragists. I saw some very fine ones in the parade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel turned indignant eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw <i>one</i> there! And I hope never to see her again!&rdquo; She said it
      severely, and the family laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head sagely under its tilting hat that came down well over
      one eye, and gave her a young and military look&mdash;as if she were
      winning her spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no place for mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right for you, I suppose?&rdquo; suggested her father teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d got over it,&rdquo; she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the measles!&rdquo; said William Archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him thoughtfully. &ldquo;Something like that&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have
      it, and you feel well&mdash;perfectly well&mdash;and then you talk with
      some one, or have tea or something, and you get all excited and
      uncomfortable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And break out&mdash;&rdquo; said William Archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and see your mother walking in the middle of the street&mdash;ploughing
      along!&rdquo; Her indignant glance was on Eleanor&rsquo;s calm face. &ldquo;I felt just
      ashamed!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought mother walked rather well!&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>I</i> was quite proud of mother!&rdquo; said William Archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I hope it&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ll have a chance to &rsquo;be proud of
      mother&rsquo;&mdash;that way!... I never dreamed she would do it!&mdash;What
      made you?&rdquo; she asked. She turned an accusing look on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I think I&mdash;caught it, perhaps,&rdquo; said Eleanor. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your
      hat just a little far forward, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel jumped up and went to the glass and adjusted the hat with
      conscientious touch. &ldquo;It looks so simple!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But it really
      takes <i>brains!</i>&mdash;There&mdash;how is that?&rdquo; She turned for
      approval, with serious, intent look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like a French cadet!&rdquo; said William Archer. He had finished luncheon,
      and was standing in the doorway looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little mouth at him, and when he had gone she came and stood by
      her father&rsquo;s chair. He looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the matinee party first; and then Helen&rsquo;s tea&mdash;it&rsquo;s her day&mdash;and
      then Harold is going to take me for a spin, if we get out in time....
      Good-by, dear things! I&rsquo;ll see you at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent and kissed them, and all the elusive perfume and shining color
      and the little flitting ends of ribbon fluttered with her from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More smiled across at his wife. &ldquo;Enter <i>Hamlet!</i>&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;It&rsquo;s all decided!&rdquo; she added softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down his cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ages ago&mdash;in heaven, I suppose.&rdquo; She smiled a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked relieved. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;<i>that</i> kind of deciding!&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey were alone at
      dinner. Annabel came in late and joined them, and there were only the
      three of them in the big room. It was very restful&mdash;with the shaded
      light from the candles; and there was a veiled happiness in the girl&rsquo;s
      smile&mdash;a little wistful look that flitted through it when it rested
      on her mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More watched in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a good time?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; She crumbled her bread absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What make of car is he running now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What make&mdash;Oh&mdash;!&rdquo; She looked up. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was scanning her mother&rsquo;s face&mdash;as if she had not quite seen her
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the prettiest thing to-day, mother&mdash;pretty for you!&rdquo; She
      leaned forward, still gazing at her. &ldquo;It would just suit you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes met the look behind the words. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A queer sort of garment&mdash;not a kimono exactly, and not a coat&mdash;just
      a garment.&rdquo; She threw open her arms with a whimsical gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother&rsquo;s look grew veiled. &ldquo;Where was it?&mdash;where did you see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Helen&rsquo;s tea. Mrs. Martin had it.... She helped pour and she had it on
      when she came in. She threw it off in the hall&mdash;a kind of regal
      thing, you know!&rdquo; She made another gesture and laughed. &ldquo;And I thought in
      a flash of <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard More was looking at his wife&mdash;her glance met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too old to wear a thing like that,&rdquo; she said tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t old, and it wasn&rsquo;t young.... It was
      just like you!&rdquo; She said it softly, half to herself under her breath, and
      she nodded to her father with a little shy pleasure in the words. &ldquo;I kept
      thinking all the time we were driving&mdash;how beautiful you would look
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What color was it?&rdquo; asked Richard More.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of blue shade&mdash;very deep and rich&mdash;and gold things
      running all over it&mdash;a perfectly stunning thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think your mother would look well in something like that?&rdquo; he said
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was turned to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see her in it,&rdquo; said the girl wistfully. &ldquo;I never
      thought before how beautiful mother is! She&rsquo;s always been&mdash;just
      mother!... I think she&rsquo;s growing pretty,&rdquo; she added reflectively. She was
      gazing at her with puzzled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;tell about the coat!&rdquo; said Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! I only saw it as she threw it off&mdash;and when we
      came out, it lay there across a chair and Harold said, &rsquo;What a stunning
      thing!&rsquo; and I said, &rsquo;Yes&mdash;for mother!&rsquo;.rdquo; She laughed and Eleanor
      smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> growing pretty, you know!&rdquo; she replied irrelevantly. &ldquo;And
      you&rsquo;re almost the only woman I know that has wrinkles&mdash;nice ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly child!&rdquo; said Eleanor. But her face flushed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been puzzling about it&mdash;about faces&mdash;lots
      of those suffrage women&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know what it was&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
      make out! But that&rsquo;s it&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t any wrinkles!&rdquo; She said it
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They <i>do</i> keep young,&rdquo; said Richard More thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him almost fiercely. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t young! It&rsquo;s&mdash;massage!
      I&rsquo;ve got so I just seem to hate that look&mdash;all puffed out and smooth
      and softish like putty. It&rsquo;s a kind of chromo-face,&rdquo; she said indignantly&mdash;&ldquo;a
      just-as-good face, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded savagely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I feel, and I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;till
      to-day.&rdquo; Her voice grew gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I get old I&rsquo;m going to have wrinkles&mdash;like mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one on your nose, now&mdash;where you&rsquo;re turning it up,&rdquo; said
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.... Now mother&rsquo;s wrinkles&rdquo;&mdash;she leaned forward and
      touched one lightly with her finger&mdash;&ldquo;mother&rsquo;s wrinkles are&mdash;<i>beautiful!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me!&rdquo; said Eleanor, with a little serene smile mocking the
      light in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;! That&rsquo;s it! Do you see?&rdquo; She motioned to her father. &ldquo;That
      little line that makes fun of you!&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to have one just like
      that!&rdquo; She leaned back and looked at the wrinkle with artistic approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she jumped up and came and put her arms around her mother&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I would let any one massage that wrinkle off your face&mdash;you
      dear old thing, you!&rdquo; She bent and kissed the wrinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Eleanor put up a hand to the smooth cheek, close against her own&mdash;with
      the little flush coming and going in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Harold say?&rdquo; she asked.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>O Annabel was
      engaged. And then, almost before they knew it, Annabel was married, and
      her place was removed from the dining-table, and the circle about the
      table closed in a little, and Eleanor looked at it with regretful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young people were not far off. And two extra plates had often to
      be laid for dinner or luncheon, or even for breakfast; so that the whole
      number of plates for the year was perhaps not much reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Archer was paying attention to his neckties and socks, and growing
      fussy about the cut of his hair. And the younger children were coming up
      with demands for a sensible education that the school system of the
      country did not supply. And Richard and Eleanor More still found life a
      rich and satisfying adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard sometimes wondered as he watched her face and the little new
      wrinkles coming to it&mdash;what life would have been if he had married
      some one else&mdash;some one besides Eleanor&mdash;the Rumley, girl, for
      instance.... He was almost engaged to the Rumley girl, at one time, he
      remembered.... He had blundered along&mdash;and heaven knows, he might
      have married the Rumley girl!... The thought always gave him a little
      fleeting shiver down his back. And then a sense of strength and well-being
      swept over him&mdash;of the inevitableness of life. It could not have been
      any other way&mdash;or any one but Eleanor!... She had said that Annabel&rsquo;s
      engagement was &ldquo;decided in heaven.&rdquo;... That was it!
    </p>
    <p>
      People might laugh&mdash;and, of course, it was a kind of fatalism&mdash;but
      things like that had to be.... The sun <i>had</i> to rise in the East
      to-morrow morning&mdash;that was not fatalism!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one regret that followed him&mdash;though he never mentioned it,
      and he seldom thought of it, consciously.... Sometimes a look in Eleanor&rsquo;s
      face would bring it back&mdash;and he would wonder why he should mind so
      much&mdash;that he had not been able to get the coat for her&mdash;the
      Chinese coat they had seen at Stewart&rsquo;s that day.... It was not such a
      wonderful garment, after all&mdash;was it?... He had given her more
      expensive things than that&mdash;more beautiful things&mdash;had he?...
      And then he would see her face as she stood for a moment wrapped in its
      folds and looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day Annabel mentioned the coat she had seen at the tea he had been
      deeply startled. And he wanted to speak to Eleanor about it afterward. But
      something held him. Perhaps she had forgotten... perhaps she did not care&mdash;so
      much as he fancied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when they were going to the opera, he turned in the limousine and
      caught a flitting smile on her lips as they flashed by a light and he
      asked her what she was thinking about. She laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chinese coat, dear.... I could have worn it to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not have told whether there were tears in her voice. He only
      thought as she stepped from the car and walked beside him into the lobby
      that he had never seen her so beautiful; and he had had the happy sense of
      people turning their heads to look at her&mdash;stare a little....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a kind of radiance about Eleanor sometimes.... He had given her
      everything in the world&mdash;except the Chinese coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the little regret never left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later it came to him that Stewart might, after all, have got the coat for
      him&mdash;and simply be waiting for him to call.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e went to
      Stewart&rsquo;s that afternoon. The store had been enlarged and greatly changed.
      He had not seen it for years&mdash;hardly since the day when he arranged,
      or thought he arranged, that they were to &ldquo;send him word.&rdquo;... Perhaps he
      had misunderstood. How foolish he had been not to inquire before....
      Regretting it all these years&mdash;and never asking&mdash;when perhaps he
      had only to walk in and say casually: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to have a coat&mdash;a
      Chinese coat&mdash;that I left an order for&mdash;blue and gold, I think
      it was&mdash;with dragons on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when he asked the casual question, the girl at the counter only shook
      her head. She was indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it this week?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been here a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it was... some time ago,&rdquo; said Richard More.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they will know in the buying department. I will ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone a long time. And Richard More looked about him. He would not
      have known it for the same place&mdash;a great skylight had been put in
      and the floors cut out from roof to basement, letting down a flood of
      light. And the stairs and elevators were changed&mdash;they used to be
      over there to the left.... It must have been just about here that she
      stood when she tried on the coat. He half-closed his eyes and saw her
      there&mdash;and all the hope and freshness came back to him&mdash;and the
      look in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl returned, efficient and indifferent. &ldquo;They have not had an order.
      I can take it again.&rdquo; She reached for her pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More looked at it distrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will see Mr. Stewart himself,&rdquo; he said slowly. He half-started
      to take a card from his pocket. Then he changed the gesture. He was
      suddenly thinking of the gold coins he had carried there....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Mr. Stewart, please, that the gentleman who left an order for a
      Chinese coat&mdash;several years ago&mdash;would like to speak with him
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another long wait&mdash;then a boy with buttons and a little
      proud air escorted him to the top of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stewart don&rsquo;t see many folks,&rdquo; he volunteered, as they approached a
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he? Then I am fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded gravely and rapped.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE gray-haired man
      at the desk looked up with a sharp line between the bushy eyebrows. He
      stared a moment and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it <i>you!</i>&rdquo; He held out a cordial hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He served on a dozen boards with Robert More&mdash;and was proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never supposed you were interested in the Chinese coat!&rdquo; He touched a
      paper on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down. They said the man who left the order was here&mdash;and I
      happened to have kept the name, &rsquo;Richard More.&rsquo; But it never occurred to
      me it was <i>you!</i>&rdquo; He was still standing and staring at him as if he
      could not quite believe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect you to remember the order,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I merely sent
      up word&mdash;on the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. &ldquo;Oh, yes. I remember it quite well.... You see I took
      personal interest in the coat. I never really meant to sell it.... It was
      a curious garment....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men of business sat silent&mdash;as if seeing it before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Stewart who roused himself first. &ldquo;I came on it in a town&mdash;a
      little back in the interior. I was there on other business,
      semi-confidential business for the government&mdash;and I saw this coat
      and liked it, and bought it.... I think I had a half-idea of giving it to
      my wife.&rdquo; He smiled a little absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know you were married,&rdquo; said Richard More politely. He really
      knew very little about the man. It did not interest him&mdash;except for
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stewart looked at him keenly a minute. &ldquo;I am not married,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      never have been.... If I had married I should not have let the Chinese
      coat go.&rdquo; He spoke with a certain curious emphasis and Richard glanced at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;I should have kept it&mdash;for her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew enough
      for that!... It gives me a queer kind of feeling to know that you were
      interested in it too. I somehow should not have suspected it of you.&rdquo; He
      looked at him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife liked it,&rdquo; said Richard stiffly. &ldquo;I wanted it for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a woman would like it.... I remember the woman that had charge
      of the department&mdash;she&rsquo;s been dead a number of years, now&mdash;I
      remember she always liked it. She would keep it in a box&mdash;half the
      time. Wouldn&rsquo;t have it out where people could see it&mdash;seemed to be
      afraid somebody would buy it!&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d really wanted to sell
      that coat I should have been pretty sharp with her.&rdquo;... He roused himself.
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t find another one, I suppose?&rdquo; said Richard politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not exactly.&rdquo; He seemed to be trying to recall something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There <i>was</i> one&mdash;I got word of one.... But it was far in the
      interior&mdash;farther in than I&rsquo;d ever gone, or had time to go. I left
      word in a general way for them to negotiate for it.... But they&rsquo;re slow&mdash;the
      Chinese.... Ever been there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard shook his head&mdash;a sudden intention came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a wonderful country!&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re a wonderful
      people. But different&mdash;different from us.... That&rsquo;s where folks have
      always made a mistake. They think because the Chinese have heads and legs,
      and wear clothes, they are like us.... But they are no more like us than&mdash;than
      trees are like&mdash;lions.... They&rsquo;re both of &rsquo;em alive, and that&rsquo;s about
      all you can say&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard smiled. &ldquo;You know them pretty well, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent a good deal of time there.... But I don&rsquo;t know them. Nobody
      knows &rsquo;em!&rdquo; He spoke with quiet conviction and something that arrested
      Richard&rsquo;s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought I should like to go there.&rdquo;... He had thought it
      not two minutes ago for the first time&mdash;but it seemed to him now that
      he had always intended to go&mdash;that it was something he had been
      moving toward all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t regret it. I mean to go back myself, some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted with a kind of friendliness they would not have expected from
      their previous knowledge of each other. Richard had in his pocket such
      directions as the man could give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you precisely where the place is, nor how to get to it. I
      never knew, myself.... And it&rsquo;s a country you have to find your own way
      in. Go slow and trust &rsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t hurry them too much.... I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      surprised if you&rsquo;d find the coat&mdash;if there really was one, like the
      one we knew&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you&rsquo;d find it just where it
      was twenty years ago when they told me about it. They&rsquo;re a slow-moving
      people! But they&rsquo;ve found out some things... some things we don&rsquo;t know
      yet.... In a sense they&rsquo;ve forgotten more than we ever knew,&rdquo; he added
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, wait a minute!&rdquo; He went to a cabinet across the room and took from
      a pigeonhole a yellow and discolored map. He brought it to the table and
      spread it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the region I spoke of&mdash;up here.... And these red lines show
      where I have been myself; and the little blue crosses are places where I
      got information&mdash;the right sort&mdash;where people are friendly and
      intelligent... they will not have changed much&mdash;&rdquo; He looked at the
      map thoughtfully and took it up and folded it in slow fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to give you this. It may be useful to you, and I may not go
      myself&mdash;I am an old man now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Richard More took the map and went out. He had come expecting to make a
      business inquiry, in a businesslike way; and he had encountered something
      that was not business&mdash;something that the piece of worn and
      discolored paper seemed vaguely to whisper as it rustled in his pocket.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next day he
      brought the runabout to the door and honked once&mdash;and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor coming down the path stopped&mdash;and glanced at the car. She
      quickened her steps, a look of happy surprise in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to drive yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me&mdash;can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got in with a sigh of content. &ldquo;There are always people!&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and people and people!&mdash;till you can&rsquo;t think!&rdquo; She threw out her
      hands in a whimsical gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you can think now!... No one to hinder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took the road to the open country. And she rested back beside him. He
      could feel her quiet contentment&mdash;though she did not speak&mdash;not
      even when they left the open highway and travelled a rougher road that
      skirted the hills and came at last to the end of a grass-grown cart-path
      half-way up the hill. He turned the nose of the car a little one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as we go,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got out with a smile. &ldquo;Farther than last time&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She
      looked about her happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember then?&rdquo; he said. He came and stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I could forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a long time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a minute,&rdquo; she replied gayly. &ldquo;Come&mdash;are we going up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;?&rdquo; He looked a little doubtfully at the hill before them&mdash;and
      there was a hill beyond that, he knew, and another beyond that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a climb than I remembered,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was already going on ahead of him, pushing aside the underbrush
      and walking with light step.... The birch stems came between them and he
      saw her hazily, always a little ahead, ascending the hill.... Then her
      pace slowed and he hurried and overtook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her sternly. &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spread his coat and she sat down on it almost meekly. She was breathing
      fast. There was a little flush of color in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her with happy eyes. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I am glad you thought of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no sense!&rdquo; said Richard shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sense&mdash;?... Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hurry like that!&mdash;We have the day before us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we?&rdquo; She looked about with a little puzzled vagueness. &ldquo;I think I
      must have been hurrying&mdash;to get back to set the table for dinner!&rdquo;
       She was laughing at him. &ldquo;It felt like being a girl!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go ahead after this,&rdquo; responded Richard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have
      you fainting away or twisting an ankle, or any other silly thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when they started again he led the way; and they stopped at judicious
      intervals&mdash;to look at the view and talk of scenery&mdash;and Richard
      kept a careful eye on the face with its flitting color, and on her
      quickened breath. She leaned a little against him the last part of the
      way. Then they came out on the open bluff, with the country lying before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood gazing down at it with shining eyes. &ldquo;Nothing has changed!&rdquo; she
      cried after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from up here,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a place for her by a birch-tree and she leaned back against it and
      they looked out in silence over the wide country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he turned and looked at her. She had fallen asleep. Her head
      rested against the birch-tree and her face wore a soft flush in sleep....
      Now that it was quiet and the smile was gone, he could see that it was
      very tired. A quick desire seized him&mdash;to keep the face&mdash;to stay
      the change in it. A woman should not grow old!... And then as he looked at
      her, he saw that she was more beautiful than she had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes and smiled to him hazily. &ldquo;Twenty-five years!&rdquo; she
      murmured sleepily, and the eyes closed. He moved a little nearer to her
      till her head rested against him and she slept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she opened her eyes, the light had changed. She sat up with a swift
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid in me&mdash;to go to sleep!... But how wonderful it is!&rdquo; She
      was gazing at the darkened light that spread like a veil over the country
      below. The grass and trees were misty in it&mdash;only a winding river
      caught a touch of glamour from an unseen source and glowed through the
      dusk. The darkness grew and deepened on the plain, and the sides of the
      hill were blurred in it&mdash;shadowy shapes crept up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;The days are short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;she breathed a little sigh&mdash;&ldquo;yes&mdash;we must go.&rdquo; She
      got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he stayed her and she stood arrested, looking down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;was something&mdash;I wanted to tell you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the plain&mdash;with the little gleaming river shining in
      it. &ldquo;It is late!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought my bug-light.&rdquo; He touched his pocket. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she sat down beside him and he told her of the map in his pocket. He
      took it out and spread it before her. And she leaned toward it in the dim
      light&mdash;studying the discolored lines as he explained them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want&mdash;to go&mdash;so much?&rdquo; she asked, looking up at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <i>you</i> want to&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martin thinks he is going to be an engineer,&rdquo; she said irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spurned it. &ldquo;Martin has sense&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t need his mother&mdash;to
      have sense for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But an engineer!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will lead the world to-morrow,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;!&rdquo; It was a little sigh of surprise and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know engineers were anything important!&rdquo; she added after a
      minute. Then she laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness gathered closer&mdash;coming up from the plain&mdash;and the
      little river was only a gleam through its veil of haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We will go. I am ready to go.... Perhaps it will
      rest me to go.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he whole family
      was at the station to see them off. Annabel had provided luncheon and a
      tea-basket and little pillows and waxed paper and drinking-cups, and she
      flitted about her mother with watchful eyes. There was a kind of jealous
      loyalty in her, as if she would hold her mother by main force from this
      foolish thing she had entered upon.... She went with them into the car and
      settled the little pillow in place and stood with her hand on her mother&rsquo;s
      shoulder.... Outside, through the window, she could see the others
      laughing and talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother lifted her face quickly. &ldquo;You will be carried off!&rdquo; she said
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger woman smiled down at her&mdash;and her face broke in little,
      helpless lines. She bent and kissed her almost fiercely. &ldquo;You take care of
      yourself!... If anything happened to you&mdash;!&rdquo; And she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the group moved and laughed and waved inane farewells. Annabel
      joined it wiping her eyes. She waved her handkerchief at the receding
      window and dabbed it swiftly across her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red light at the end of the rear car receded into a dark tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel caught her breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we let her do it!&rdquo; she said
      helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t stop mother!&rdquo; It was William Archer. He tucked her hand
      protectingly in his arm. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right!&rdquo; he said reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel shook her head. They had turned away from the blackness of the
      tunnel and were walking toward the station. The others had scattered a
      little, and gone on ahead. Annabel&rsquo;s eyes followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t fit to do it!&rdquo; she said.... &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like a child. I feel as if I
      couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;!&rdquo; Her lip trembled, and she broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Archer smiled down at her. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s all right! She brought us up&mdash;five
      of us. And she&rsquo;s pretty near brought father up&mdash;and I guess a few
      Chinamen won&rsquo;t frighten her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel looked at him absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell her where I put the extra flannels&mdash;for the steamer.
      They say it&rsquo;s cold&mdash;sometimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telegraph!&rdquo; replied William Archer promptly. &ldquo;Want me to go home with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood at the corner of the street. Annabel shook her head. &ldquo;Of course
      not! Don&rsquo;t be silly!... I shall telegraph to-night&mdash;a night-letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereto?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him helplessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.... And she&rsquo;s always been so
      fixed before! Wherever I went, I seemed always just kind of circling
      around mother and coming back to her. And now she&rsquo;s off like that&mdash;whirling
      into space!&rdquo; She made a sweeping gesture of her hands and looked up to him
      appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little laugh left William Archer&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one in the world,
      of course, like mother.... Never has been&mdash;for me.... I suppose all
      men feel that way&mdash;about their mothers.&rdquo; He said it slowly and looked
      at her inquiringly. &ldquo;But it seems somehow as if she were somebody in
      particular&mdash;and nobody else could know&mdash;how we feel about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t&mdash;and they don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Annabel grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking at each other with quiet understanding. They had not
      felt so near together in years, not since they played in the branches of
      the oak-tree, and William Archer had called down to her from the topmost
      branch: &ldquo;Come on up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded to him with a little smile of remembrance and affection, and
      they turned and went their separate ways.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rom the window of
      the train Eleanor More looked out on green fields. They had emerged from
      the dark mouth of the tunnel into a spring day. The evening light was on
      the fields, and they stretched away to distant woods. The shadows along
      the ground caught a glow from the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like a clear day to-morrow,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded quietly. Her eyes were on the level green fields that moved
      past them, mile after mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand and covered hers where it lay on the seat between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. Then she drew a long breath and looked at him with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good it seems!&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;How good it seems&mdash;to get away
      from them all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are beginning all over,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.... I can&rsquo;t seem to worry about what&rsquo;s happening to them.... Just a
      little worry&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over that in a mile or so,&rdquo; he replied confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem she did get over it&mdash;or at least if she did not, she
      concealed it skilfully. The little lines in her face smoothed, one by one,
      and a tranquil look came to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for hours as the train moved over the level plain, the look of
      abstraction in her eyes and the gentleness and strength in her face
      revealing themselves&mdash;as the lines of a landscape are sometimes
      revealed by a change of light or by the passing of a storm&mdash;all the
      surface life slipped from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Richard More, watching, had a sudden sense of the mysterious force of
      very familiar things.... This was Eleanor&rsquo;s face&mdash;that he had known
      and loved for years; and it was the face of a strange woman, an unknown
      majestic presence who moved beside him always.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the mask of greatness would slip from her, and she would chatter
      for days about nothing, trivial things&mdash;delighting like a child in
      the discoveries he brought and laid in her lap when he alighted at some
      lonely station&mdash;a flower or a bit of mineral; and the train would
      plunge on again, dipping around the curve of a hill, climbing along a
      dizzy cliff, while she sat beside him, her hand a little reached out to
      him, her breath half stayed by a glance of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a voyage of discovery,&rdquo; he said in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish&mdash;to want to stay in one place&mdash;always!&rdquo; Her hand
      swept up to the piling masses of snow, glacial vastnesses that gleamed
      high above them. &ldquo;How foolish!&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the strange look of dignity and strength came swiftly into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A voyage of discovery,&rdquo; he repeated.... &ldquo;Do you think we shall find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with puzzled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find&mdash;?&rdquo; she said vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chinese coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;!&rdquo; she laughed out. &ldquo;Perhaps so. It doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;does
      it?&rdquo; She nodded toward the distant peaks of snow&mdash;a faint tinge of
      pink was beginning to rest on them.... &ldquo;It does not matter!&rdquo; she said
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it does not matter.... But I should like to find it&mdash;for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she looked at him her eyes were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish boy!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to care&mdash;for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go back&mdash;if you say so,&rdquo; he responded. He was watching her
      closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached out a quick hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Oh, no! We must go on!&rdquo; she cried under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed out. &ldquo;I thought so! You care for it&mdash;as much as I do....
      Only
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go on,&rdquo; she said swiftly. &ldquo;What would the children say&mdash;if
      we should come back now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be a little surprised&mdash;to see us walk in,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, madam&mdash;to please you, we will go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked in any foolish way that pleased them, and they did not hurry
      on the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a time-table of the dates of sailing of the Japanese line they were
      to travel by, and a stateroom engaged on each boat sailing for the next
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after one he relinquished them, by telegraph, as the days slipped by.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped off for two weeks at a high mountain inn that they liked; and
      several times they rested for days in some spot that pleased her fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her face. When it grew fatigued, he gave directions to the
      Japanese courier who had joined them at a point on the journey, and they
      left the train at the next station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courier came and went like a shadow along the route&mdash;sometimes
      ahead of them and sometimes following, but always at hand when he was
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor grew to watch for his face as if he were a kind of meteor that
      played a game with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; she would exclaim at some station as she looked out and
      caught a glimpse of him. &ldquo;There he is, Richard!&rdquo; And if the train went on
      without him, she would press her face to the glass and lean forward to
      watch till he was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful people!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I see him I seem to understand&mdash;almost!
      And then he is gone! Is he going with us&mdash;all the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I had arranged with him only to San
      Francisco. But we can keep him on if you like.... There will be plenty
      like him on the boat. They are all Japs on the boat.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the steamer they
      were, as Richard had predicted, all Japanese. Not only the crew and
      attendants, but many of the passengers showed the dark skin and straight
      hair of the race to the west. There were Chinese, too, and strange foreign
      faces that Richard More did not know. A few Americans were on board&mdash;bound
      on business or pleasure to China and Japan&mdash;but the majority of the
      passengers were of alien race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More and his wife sat day after day in their steamer-chairs,
      looking out to sea and watching the strange faces drift between them and
      the horizon line.... They came and went, dreamlike and vague.... Now a
      face would silhouette itself on the sky, turbaned and dark and motionless
      against the approaching west; and now gesticulating hands moved swiftly,
      and sharp staccatoed words flitted by them along the deck. They were in a
      foreign world, a cosmopolite world&mdash;a restless, moving strangeness of
      life.... It was not possible not to feel, deep underneath, the common tie
      of race or nation that made them one.... Only a boat moving to the west&mdash;and
      the faces moving with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courier left them at the dock at San Francisco. Eleanor caught a
      glimpse of his face among the crowd as the boat moved out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; she cried to Richard, her hand on his arm and her eyes
      searching the dock. Then the crowd jostled&mdash;and the face was gone.
      There were many dark faces along the dock&rsquo;s edge, watching the boat
      recede, and she could not see that one was more familiar than another.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to fancy on the journey that she knew the courier a little;
      but now she saw that she had known only his strangeness; there were dozens
      like him, and he was merged in the deeper alienism of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was replaced by a Chinese interpreter who was to act as guide for the
      rest of the journey. Richard More, searching for a courier who was
      familiar with the languages and dialects of the different provinces of
      China, had come upon Kou Ying, who was contemplating a journey home. For a
      consideration, he was willing to go with them into the interior and to
      remain with them as long as they wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor had seen him only at a distance, leaning against the rail and
      looking out to sea, or rolling a cigarette with slow lingering touch in
      his yellow hands extending from the wide, silken sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fancied, once or twice, that a glance from the oblique eyes rested on
      her with slow intentness. But when she looked again she saw that the
      glance was vacant of meaning and that it slipped past her and gazed out
      along the pathless sea to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make him out!&rdquo; she said to Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like him?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;We will exchange him at Shanghai.
      There are always plenty to be had, I understand. But I thought the man
      seemed intelligent&mdash;and the boat gives us a little chance to get
      acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her keenly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to keep him, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrinkled her eyes in a little perplexity, gazing at the figure that
      stood well to the front of the boat.... His back was turned to them and
      the wind blowing against the boat filled the blue coat and trousers like
      little balloons. One could fancy the thin yellow legs inside the balloons,
      holding like grim little steel pipes to the deck. There was a wiry
      strength in the man and a kind of gripping forcefulness that went oddly
      with the placid face and slow figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I do not dislike him. But he
      makes me feel as if the world were queer&mdash;a little topsy-turvy, I
      think&mdash;almost as if I saw a pine-tree lift its roots out of the
      ground and go skipping along the grass!&rdquo; Her husband laughed out. &ldquo;Kou
      Ying doesn&rsquo;t skip much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... His soul skips!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better for us, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes brooded on the ballooning little figure,
      anchored to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Don&rsquo;t send him away!&rdquo; She shook her head with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you like him. I fancy he&rsquo;s going to be pretty useful to us
      later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and strolled over to the man, and Eleanor More watched the two
      figures side by side&mdash;the tall, well-built American and the thin
      little figure of steel in its swelling, puffed-out garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they moved along the deck and passed out of sight. When they
      reappeared, at the other end of the boat, Eleanor was lying half-asleep,
      her eyes closed and her face very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes, as they came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oblique gaze was looking down on her out of an impassive face. She
      smiled dreamily.... Now she understood. The man was journeying too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Kou Ying,&rdquo; said Richard casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oriental made a gesture of service... and the pine-tree danced hazily
      before Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes. She smiled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going with us?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stolid face had not changed. But something, far back in the eyes,
      responded to the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as you need me, madam,&rdquo; said the man courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are looking for a coat,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you told him?&rdquo; asked Eleanor, a little astonished. She sat up in
      her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I waited&mdash;to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese eyes regarded him, incurious and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw a coat, several years ago,&rdquo; said Richard, addressing them. &ldquo;A coat
      that we should like to find&mdash;or one like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mandarin coat?&rdquo; asked the man quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so. It was longer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue, with gold things on it&mdash;Dragons,&rdquo; said Eleanor eagerly, &ldquo;and
      marks down the front like this&mdash;&rdquo; She drew a few lines on the paper
      beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s breath gave a little whistling sound....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very old coat,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Hundreds of years&mdash;very,
      very old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face took on a strange, removed look. &ldquo;It will be difficult to find&mdash;I
      am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke the words with a clear, clipping sound, and looked out to the
      west, steadying himself to the motion of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not many chances of finding it,&rdquo; he said at last with grave
      accent. &ldquo;But I will help you&mdash;if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are depending on you,&rdquo; said Richard More.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Eleanor saw him often, mingling with the different groups of
      Chinamen on the deck and talking and laughing with easy familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is making inquiries,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;He tells me there are people on
      board from nearly every province in China. He may find a clew before we
      leave the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have been only imagination on Eleanor&rsquo;s part that the groups of
      Chinamen began to regard her with interest. As they passed her chair, she
      would fancy for a moment she caught a gleam in the opaque black eyes....
      Then, as she looked, it was gone.... A group of them, by the ship&rsquo;s rail,
      talking in clear staccato tones, would give her a sudden sense that she
      was closely concerned in what they were saying. But when she looked, the
      stolid faces were as impassive as the long black queues depending from
      each round hat almost to the ship&rsquo;s deck and responding in oblique black
      lines to the attraction of gravity&mdash;as the boat moved up and down....
      After a time she ceased to think of them. She sat in her chair, day after
      day, with half-closed eyes, watching the faces drift past and the water
      beyond the ship&rsquo;s rail rise and fall.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY made no
      friends on the boat as they had made none in the train. It had rested her
      to leave all social relations behind as the train moved west, and she
      showed a strange reluctance to forming new ties. She seemed to have swung
      free from the past.... Richard, as he watched her, had a sense that she
      gathered herself for something she was journeying to meet.... Her face
      against the steamer-chair seemed to absorb light. It held a still look&mdash;as
      if it waited some signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Eleanor More, lying in her chair, made no acquaintances on the
      boat, and if the groups of Chinamen did not seem to observe her as they
      passed, there were others on the boat who showed open interest in the
      quiet figure that lay day after day looking under lowered lids to the
      west.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than one woman slowed her pace as she came near the steamer-chair.
      Sometimes they lingered a moment ready to enter into conversation. But it
      was always Richard More who spoke to them, and after a minute&rsquo;s courteous
      talk walked on with them, leaving the steamer-chair to its unbroken quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His care for his wife, his almost reverent watchfulness for the figure in
      the chair, gave it a place apart, an aloofness that no one broke in upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet often they saw her, from a distance, laughing and talking with her
      husband like a child. There was something unwarranted in the sweetness and
      freshness of her laugh.... It seemed to have left care behind, and yet to
      be filled with sympathy that sprang from a deep place.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman with little fine lines in her face and a quick mobile mouth looked
      at her companion and smiled, as the laugh came to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been standing by the boat-rail, looking out to sea, silent for a
      long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned the smile. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only thinking&mdash;<i>she knows!</i>&rdquo; She made a little gesture
      toward the steamer-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows what?&rdquo; said the man vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;Things I would give my life for!&rdquo; She
      turned her back on him. Her eyes followed the foam in the boat&rsquo;s wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her a minute in silence. Then he moved nearer to her and laid
      his hand on hers where it lay on the boat&rsquo;s rail. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and smiled. &ldquo;I cannot be sure!&rdquo; She faced him. &ldquo;If I
      were sure... I would marry you to-morrow&mdash;to-day&mdash;any time!&rdquo; She
      threw the words at him. &ldquo;How can one be <i>sure?</i>&rdquo; He regarded her
      gravely. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what it means?... Isn&rsquo;t that a part of it&mdash;to
      take the risk?... Suppose there were no risk... would that be&mdash;love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; She spoke as if urged by
      something within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she turned to him. &ldquo;It used to be so simple&mdash;to be a
      woman.... One loved and married&mdash;and there were children&mdash;and
      then one died. That was all! But now&mdash;!&rdquo; She broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Now, you are free&mdash;and being free, you must choose&mdash;And
      that means knowledge.&rdquo; He looked at her narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; She moved a little from him. &ldquo;And I shall know&mdash;when I have
      made the mistake&mdash;perhaps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you take the risk!&rdquo; he responded cheerfully. &ldquo;Shall we go for our
      walk? That is <i>safe</i>&mdash;ten times round the deck&mdash;six times a
      day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and placed her hand in his arm and they swung into the easy
      step of the ship&rsquo;s constitutional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six times they passed the quiet figure in its chair. Then the woman slowed
      her pace a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bear it any longer&mdash;not to know!&rdquo; She lifted her hand to
      the figure wrapped in its steamer-rug and lying so still. &ldquo;When I look at
      her&mdash;I cannot bear it!... <i>She knows</i>. She has foregathered with
      the great&mdash;! She knows the secret!&rdquo; They had come to a stop, and she
      turned to him. &ldquo;If I marry you I shall not be happy&mdash;&rdquo; She seemed to
      throw out the words accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy now?&rdquo; he asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am free!&rdquo; she flung back.... &ldquo;There are things women must do&mdash;for
      the world!&rdquo; She looked about her vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is one of them&mdash;perhaps. But&mdash;&rdquo; He looked at her narrowly.
      &ldquo;Not unless&mdash;you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and smiled subtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to do brave things. I want to vote and reform cities and states. I
      want to found kingdoms and rule them! But&mdash;I am&mdash;going to marry
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved a little toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up her hand. &ldquo;I am going to marry you&mdash;because you hold the
      secret&mdash;of the Past.... I cannot live without it.&rdquo; She caught her
      breath and half reached out her hands&mdash;as if to a blind god who
      demanded sacrifice. There was a wistful look in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded it sharply. &ldquo;You think you will fathom the Past&mdash;by
      marrying me?... That is why you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on her and looked over the rail, out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman is going to march through my heart, slamming doors behind her!&rdquo;
       he said under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded the obstinate back a minute and her face grew tender.... She
      had become gentle&mdash;as if she saw something precious. She put out her
      hand and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of me, Gordon! I will wait&mdash;at the threshold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled suddenly and held out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she glanced over her shoulder. Only the empty decks&mdash;a Japanese
      sailor lounging by the rail&mdash;and the quiet figure of the woman asleep
      in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put up her face with the breath of a kiss and drew near to him.... And
      in her half-slumber, beneath lowered lids, Eleanor More dreamed on.... And
      the boat moved to the west and to the new world&mdash;the old world of the
      Past&mdash;new with coming life in the cycles of the earth and the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Shanghai there were a few days of delay while Kou Ying arranged for
      accommodations on the river-steamer, and telegraphed ahead for runners and
      provisions and an escort to be waiting at the various points where they
      might wish to stop off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had instructed him to make arrangements that would leave them free
      to follow any clew that developed as they went. Strings of cash were
      provided and paid out by Kou Ying with judicious, watchful hand; and banks
      in the interior received word to hold sums subject to call. The news of
      the American who was to follow, penetrated far ahead.... If any help were
      to be had from tradition or rumor Kou Ying had set turning the wheels that
      would bring it to them as they ascended the long meandering river that
      stretches from east to west across the country and forms the waterway and
      news route of all upper China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in Shanghai the little party became the subject of almost official
      interest. Courteous overtures were made to Richard More of information to
      be had&mdash;at a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capacious suite of rooms Kou Ying engaged for them in Shanghai&rsquo;s
      leading hotel became an emporium of silks and stuffs and woven garments of
      every shape and kind.... Colored brocades, rich embroideries stiff with
      gold and gorgeous designs lay about on chairs and tables; and
      yellow-skinned merchants from the native part of the city displayed their
      trays and rolls of precious coats and robes for the American lady&rsquo;s
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she turned from them all with a little smile. &ldquo;It was much simpler
      than any of these, and more beautiful&mdash;I think,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Kou Ying interpreted her words, to them, they repacked the
      garments in their long trays, and saluted her gravely and retired.... Was
      it only fancy, or did swift looks cross between the impassive faces as
      they moved from her?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if she were in a veiled world&mdash;tissues of filmy
      thinness.... She had only to put out her hand and brush them aside&mdash;to
      find what she sought&mdash;something beautiful and fine and eternal that
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumors from the old city were brought that Kou Ying sifted with cautious
      hand. Of some he made notes on the thin, yellow, rustling paper he always
      carried with him; and some he dismissed with a curt wave that swept the
      bearers in ignominious retreat from his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fled from the august wrath of this man who had learned American ways,
      but who had not forgotten, it would seem, the duplicity and crookedness of
      his native land!
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More saw very little of Kou Ying during these days of preparation.
      Except when he was acting as interpreter for her, he came and went with
      even, inscrutable countenance, arranging details, directing movements&mdash;preparing
      for the long and difficult journey that lay ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never by word or movement did he indicate other than the most casual
      interest in the object of their journey or in his employers. He gave the
      service agreed upon and he handled Richard More&rsquo;s money with scrupulous
      exactness; but he showed no other sign of caring for the expedition or of
      interest in its success.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the preliminary arrangements were concluded and they sat on the
      boat&rsquo;s deck looking out across the Chinese landscape that the season of
      high water made visible on either bank, Kou Ying showed even less interest
      in their movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat, or stood, a little distance from them, his gaze resting stolidly
      on the level fields and low-lying crops, as they moved past. At a sign
      from Richard he would approach and explain some point of interest, or give
      information as to the average yield of the fertile soil or the price of
      crops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a courteous moment of silence, he would return to his solitary
      watching, and the look of withdrawal would come over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mile after mile they saw the unvarying fields go by, and the multitudinous
      boats pass and repass on the great river.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years, it seemed to them, they had been making their way through this
      fertile land, plying a steady course up the winding stream that led to the
      unknown country they sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one morning Kou Ying came to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few hours we disembark,&rdquo; he said courteously. &ldquo;There is a shop in
      Ichang you may wish to visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the shop in Ichang proved only a duplicate of the shops of old
      Shanghai, and they returned to the river and moved on&mdash;this time in
      their own boat, a clumsy, roomy junk that went more slowly and was
      propelled by the wind or by stalwart rowers&mdash;up through great gorges,
      where the river made its tortuous way&mdash;up, steadily up, over rapids
      or along the smooth-flowing water between gigantic walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Eleanor More watched the muscles in the half-naked backs, bending
      to the oars or tugging and straining at the rope that hauled the boat
      through swift foaming rapids, she felt as if she ascended some great river
      of a dream world.... So Dante may have watched the shades appear and
      vanish, or a turn of the journey reveal new and mysterious regions of the
      unknown world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already they had fallen into the habit of saying little. They sat in the
      sedan chairs that had been provided for the upper reaches, motionless and
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above them the great walls stretched dizzily or opened out around quiet
      waters where the light lay dazzling on distant peaks; or they watched the
      water as it broke and swirled about the bow and the boat groaned and
      bumped under the tugging strain that brought it at last one reach higher
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the journey was halted for expeditions into the country on one side
      or the other as they made their way steadily toward the Thibetan ranges
      that stretched to the west. But no clew had been reached.... Always the
      courteous reception of Kou Ying&rsquo;s inquiries&mdash;always the spreading
      before them of gorgeous robes and flower-embroidered garments&mdash;but no
      glimpse or hint of a blue coat and shining dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to feel as if it were a dream,&rdquo; said Eleanor, &ldquo;we have been
      remembering all these years&mdash;only a dream-coat. It was so long ago!&rdquo;
       she mused. &ldquo;And this is another life.&rdquo; She motioned to the strange fields
      about them&mdash;the low houses among the trees and the carved, fantastic
      temple rising from the grove near by. &ldquo;Almost another world!&rdquo; she
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sedan chairs halted for luncheon. A little distance away, the bearers
      sat or lolled at rest. In the distance Kou Ying consulted with a Taoist
      priest, who shook his head and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw Kou Ying move swiftly after him and press a coin in his hand. The
      priest stopped and regarded it with passing motion, and spoke a few words
      again, and shook his head and went on to his temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying returned to them with the usual formula of failure. He motioned
      to the bearers to take up the chairs and continue the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Richard More stayed him. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said. He was searching in his
      pocket for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying paused without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Richard More took from his pocket a yellow paper, and began to unfold
      it with slow, rustling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oriental&rsquo;s face changed subtly. He moved toward it and reached out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More looked up. &ldquo;I had forgotten&mdash;that I had it,&rdquo; he said
      absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying reached to it. But Richard held it away. His finger traced a line
      along the paper and paused....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be the place&mdash;here?&rdquo; He looked about him, at the
      clustering houses and the Taoist temple on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying&rsquo;s face bent eagerly above the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he asked huskily. There was a strange, quiet
      gleam in the yellow face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man I told you of&mdash;Stewart&mdash;gave it to me.... I had
      forgotten&mdash;till now. Will it help, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying looked at him, almost with compassion, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His finger touched the paper. But he made no further move to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold it to the light!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Richard More held it against the light they saw, gleaming high,
      an imperial dragon and beside it the four strange cabalistic marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the royal seal,&rdquo; said Kou Ying quietly&mdash;&ldquo;the seal of a dynasty
      long since deposed. Only documents of rare value are inscribed on this
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited a moment in silence. &ldquo;It will tell us the way,&rdquo; he said
      slowly&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever sees that paper must speak true words&mdash;on penalty of
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. &ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Richard More yielded it without demur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s whole bearing had changed. His face had lost its sullen look. He
      gazed down at the yellowed paper with quiet intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he looked up. The smile on his face was youthful and full of
      light. The antagonism was gone, and the repression and difference of race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had known before&mdash;that you carried this,&rdquo; he said gently.
      He smoothed it in his yellow fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have done&mdash;different?&rdquo; asked Richard, a little
      curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have served you in spirit,&rdquo; said Kou Ying. &ldquo;This is the map of
      the spirit country.&rdquo; He touched it reverently and waited a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you more. My words would not have meaning&mdash;for you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Eleanor More leaned forward a little, with parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; she said swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kou Ying looked at her a moment in grave silence. The paper in his
      hand seemed to radiate a kind of light and remove him mistily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&mdash;all that the paper can tell. You will
      know&mdash;soon.... But I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He motioned to the bearers and they took up the chairs and moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And wherever the chairs halted and the paper was presented, there was
      swift hurrying and obedient response to Kou Ying&rsquo;s questions and demands.
      The little procession became a kind of royal convoy. Each village that was
      entered received it with honor and hastened to serve it and to speed it on
      its way&mdash;almost as if eager to be rid of so fateful a mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no dallying in progress now, and no detours leading to fruitless
      results. Each halt found the route ahead prepared and directions ready for
      Kou Ying&rsquo;s hand.... But the end that they sought was always a little
      farther on&mdash;a day&rsquo;s journey on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the travelled region and ascended into a hilly country where the
      road wound constantly up and the bearers were obliged to force their way
      through paths that were no longer wide enough for two abreast. At last
      only the empty chairs could be carried and they ascended by slow stages,
      halting often to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are near the end now!&rdquo; Kou Ying looked gravely at Eleanor More.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face had grown a little tired, but it held a light that scanned each
      break in the road with quiet happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More watched her uneasily. &ldquo;You are not tired?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I am strangely rested.... I am getting acclimated,
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked again at the quiet face. It was true that it seemed rested&mdash;more
      rested than he had ever seen it. But there was a pallor about it that
      touched him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and held it in his as they ascended the hill, guiding
      her, almost carrying her over the rough places, till the path before them
      opened out into a little clearing and they stood on the summit of the
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below them the path wound downward to a valley of trees and little farms
      that stretched away to the plain; and in the centre of the valley stood a
      walled city.... They noted the circling walls and the gates and towers
      that thrust upward. In the midst of the city was a curious and rounded
      mountain, and on the summit of the mountain two thin, shining trees and a
      temple with little points and peaks glinted in the light.... Below the
      temple, shrined in the face of the mountain, something glowed. The light
      fell on it and shifted a little and the sun that had been struggling
      through gray clouds shone full on the face of the god&mdash;hewn from the
      ribs of the mountain and gilded till it shone like brass.... Colossal in
      dignity and repose, the great face gazed out over the roofs and towers of
      the walled city, to the plain beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More caught her breath and leaned forward, gazing with quiet eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying beside her gave a quick cry and flung himself prostrate on his
      face.... And all the bearers of the little retinue as they came straggling
      into the opening prostrated themselves, with half-uttered sounds of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More, standing among the kneeling figures, noted quietly the
      distance of the descending path that led to the city. And when Kou Ying
      rose and stood beside him, the American motioned with his hand to the
      mountain and the god that faced them, rising above the city walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From here we go on alone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying gazed at him a moment in silence. He seemed weighing something in
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will need an interpreter,&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More laughed out. He touched the string of cash that hung beneath
      his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kou Ying shook his head with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go to the temple&mdash;not the one above, but below. Beside the
      Buddha&mdash;can you see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard More shaded his eyes, and nodded assent. At the base of the
      mountain, rising barely to the knees of the great seated figure, he could
      see the other temple huddled among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go there&mdash;and inquire. Here&mdash;take the map. I think we are very
      near now. But&mdash;&rdquo; Kou Ying hesitated. &ldquo;I should feel safer&mdash;&rdquo; he
      murmured. Then his eyes fell on Eleanor More standing with relaxed hands,
      waiting, and his face lighted and glowed curiously. He drew aside with a
      gesture of abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you need me, signal from the gate&mdash;or from the wall. I shall wait
      here with the men&mdash;and come if you need me.&rdquo; He bowed gravely and
      motioned to the men. They drew back and watched the two figures descend
      the winding path that led to the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a rock obscured them, and sometimes they passed under
      overhanging trees or disappeared beneath the arch of a bridge or fantastic
      tower that spanned the way.... Each time a little nearer to the city and
      to the great seated figure of the Buddha of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the two figures halted a minute at the gate and disappeared
      within the wall Kou Ying made a significant gesture to the men; and the
      little retinue in the clearing on the mountain above the valley fell on
      their faces in silence....
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the valley, the great Buddha brooded, and above it rose the temple
      and two thin trees, transparent in the gray morning light.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the high plateau that faced the god, the single figure of Kou Ying
      stood erect among the kneeling men and kept watch for a signal from the
      gate or the city wall.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hrough his barred
      window, the old priest looked out at them with unseeing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval and he stood beside them, looking down at their
      dusty clothes and travel-stained faces with quiet, understanding gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the interpreter came, with his high, sing-song words that
      translated their wishes, even before Richard More took from his pocket the
      yellow map and laid it in the old priest&rsquo;s hand, they knew that they were
      come to the end of their search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest listened with bowed head. Once or twice he nodded assent, and
      when the interpreter finished, he looked at Eleanor More with slow, kind
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded the map and handed it back and pointed to a little house among
      the trees. Then he spoke to the interpreter in a low tone and motioned to
      the figure of the god cut in the rock above, and entered the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man, half-asleep before his door, roused himself. He listened to
      the interpreter and shook his head. His face was as motionless as the
      plank it leaned against.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter spoke again, sharply, and the old eyes turned to him with
      slow, incurious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter flung one hand upward, toward the seated Buddha towering
      above; and the old gaze followed it unsteadily&mdash;up&mdash;up to the
      great gilded face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long minute he gazed at the god in the face of the mountain. Then he
      rose slowly and entered the darkened house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard a sound of scraping within and a creaking, as if a door opened,
      then silence.... The city was very quiet about them&mdash;a gentle
      intoning from the temple and a rustling of leaves on the mountainside.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time they waited in the silence before the half-swung door. The
      old man appeared and beckoned to them and they passed into the cool quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traversed a passage and crossed a court and entered a low room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty except for two objects on the right as they entered&mdash;a
      shrine to Buddha revealed through the half-open doors the god within; and
      across the room on a raised platform facing the shrine stood a
      red-and-black lacquered coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of the coffin Eleanor More&rsquo;s face changed subtly. She turned
      to the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you brought us to a house of mourning?&rdquo; Her hand moved toward
      the raised platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man at the interpreter&rsquo;s side spoke a few words.... And the
      interpreter translated in his sing-song voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his son&mdash;who is dead. He has no other to do him honor,&rdquo; he
      chanted slowly, as if the words were full of presage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Eleanor More&rsquo;s eyes turned to the old man with a quiet look. But the
      stolid face gave no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a courteous gesture and a low word to the interpreter, the old man
      moved toward the shrine across the room and, squatting before it, opened a
      drawer beneath the half-open doors and drew out an oblong box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three people standing by the red-and-black coffin waited quietly as he
      lifted it and turned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Richard More.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a curious thrill&mdash;as if at the end of a long quest he put out
      his hand in the dark and touched a human hand like his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man crossed to them in silence, and laying the box on the platform
      by the coffin lifted the lid.... A faint scent of spices drifted out; it
      floated about them and enveloped them as he took out, one by one, the soft
      thin papers that filled the box, and revealed lying at the bottom
      something that glowed and shimmered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More leaned forward breathless. Her hands half-reached to the
      shimmer of blue and gold as the old man lifted it from the box and opened
      it with slow, reverent fingers.... The dragon&rsquo;s played across the surface,
      and on the breast as he held it up were four cabalistic marks&mdash;the
      signs in the transparent map that guided them on their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood a moment in silence. All the color of the coat seemed to gather
      to a soft intensity, and glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More caught her breath with a little sound. &ldquo;I had forgotten!&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I had forgotten....!&rdquo; Her face was filled with light&mdash;a look
      of happiness pervaded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More glanced at her. &ldquo;Ask him how much it is,&rdquo; he said in a low
      voice to the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter spoke the words and listened a moment and translated the
      answer swiftly: &ldquo;Money will not buy the coat&mdash;not all the gold in all
      the world,&rdquo; he chanted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again Richard More made his demand.... And again he offered
      larger sums. But the old face opposite remained untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money cannot buy it,&rdquo; replied the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a refrain that came and went between the two men, as they
      faced each other&mdash;Richard More urgent, imperious, and strong; the old
      Chinaman impassive and quiet. His face had not changed from its look of
      calm endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not sell it,&rdquo; repeated the interpreter. &ldquo;He only shows it to you
      at the priest&rsquo;s command. It is a legacy&mdash;from mother to son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His son is dead,&rdquo; said Richard almost harshly. His hand moved to the
      coffin with an abrupt gesture.... &ldquo;His son is dead&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words held themselves on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was facing a small door across the room. His hand fell to his side in a
      gesture of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman in the doorway stood looking at them with deep, intent gaze.
      Then she moved toward them&mdash;as one who comes in her own right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke a word to the interpreter. He gave quiet assent and waited while
      she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says the coat is of royal lineage,&rdquo; he translated slowly&mdash;&ldquo;a
      heritage in her family&mdash;since Time.... She is of a dynasty long since
      deposed. Only the coat remains. No one remembers whence it came&mdash;no
      one reads the dragon marks....&rdquo; He translated the words as they came from
      her lips in quaint exact phrasing. &ldquo;But there is a tradition&mdash;&rdquo; his
      voice went on&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened again&mdash;a half-curious flutter of his lids rested on
      Eleanor More&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had withdrawn to one side and stood looking down at the red-and-black
      lacquered surface of the coffin.... Her hands were folded quietly.
      Something within her seemed to hold itself remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze ran from her to the woman who stood speaking the words that he
      translated, half under his breath&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a tradition&mdash;&rdquo; he repeated softly, &ldquo;that the coat is
      immortal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned to it where it lay beside the coffin. It seemed to shimmer and
      gather light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;a tradition that the coat is immortal,&rdquo; went on the singing voice
      of the interpreter.... &ldquo;And one day there shall come from the East&mdash;a
      woman&mdash;a woman out of the East.... And her sons shall cherish the
      coat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More stirred a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the interpreter took on a high sing-song note, alternating
      with the low, gentle phrasing of the Chinese woman&rsquo;s words.... &ldquo;Her sons
      and her sons&rsquo; sons&mdash;forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice ceased and the room was very still. From somewhere in the house
      came a rustling sound that rose and died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanor More raised her eyes and looked steadfastly at the other woman.
      She moved a step&mdash;and half held out her hands. But the other did not
      stir and she crossed the space between them.... They were of equal height.
      As Richard More turned a startled glance, he was aware of something
      curiously alike in the two figures&mdash;a lift of the head, an air of
      quiet endurance&mdash;but more than all, a kind of dignity&mdash;something
      regal&mdash;that stirred vague memories.... When had he stood before and
      seen two women thus?... Surely in some other life&mdash;in some other age
      and time, he had looked on at a supreme moment of joy and abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long moment, the two women confronted each other, gazing deep into
      the other&rsquo;s eyes. Then with a little gesture, the Oriental, in her softly
      rustling garments, moved to the platform and lifted the Chinese coat in
      her hands and placed it in Eleanor More&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were there tears in the eyes that gazed... or only a deep, still joy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Richard More could question&mdash;the look was gone. The Oriental
      woman was moving from them and the door closed softly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched it swing together, with a sense that something irretrievable
      had passed&mdash;a mystery and wonder&mdash;out of life.... Then he turned
      and saw his wife&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gazing down at the coat with a look almost of fear. &ldquo;Her sons and
      her sons&rsquo; sons&mdash;forever,&rdquo; flashed through his mind.... She lifted her
      eyes and smiled at him, holding out the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry it for me, Dick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved quickly toward her. &ldquo;You are tired?&rdquo; he said tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I am not tired!&rdquo; She looked about her. &ldquo;I am only glad.... It
      was a long journey, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She spoke with quiet conviction. &ldquo;But now
      it seems short&mdash;and easy to find....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her again. Her eyes rested wonderingly on the shrine of
      the Buddha and on the shallow platform with its coffin and the three men
      standing by it....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been here before, I think&mdash;and yet...&rdquo; She passed her hand
      across her eyes. &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; He had taken the coat from her and handed it to the
      interpreter, who was folding it in slow, skilful hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Chinaman had not stirred from his place, a little to one side. He
      looked on with impassive gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More glanced at him and a sense of something wonted came to him...
      a sudden vision of the oak-tree with its great roots protruding from the
      ground, and the low-swung branches. He moved quickly to the platform. From
      about his neck he removed the long strings of cash and placed them beside
      the coffin and from his pocket he took handfuls of the Chinese silver
      &ldquo;shoes&rdquo; that had served them on their journey.... They would not need them
      now.... He piled them about the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old eyes of the Chinaman gazed straight before him. His lips parted in
      half-spoken words that the interpreter took up, translating softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will go to the grave of his ancestors.... He is old and his sons are
      dead.... He will bury this son, the last of his race&mdash;&rdquo; His hand
      touched the lacquered surface gently. &ldquo;He will offer worship at the sacred
      mountain and pay vows before the tomb of his ancestors. The money you have
      given shall make glad the hearts of his ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased. The old man approached the coffin. For a long moment he stood
      with hands resting on it&mdash;as if he would gather from it something of
      the strength of the race that was passing. Then with grave face he lifted
      the strings of cash and placed them about his neck and gathered up the
      silver shoes from beside the coffin and took from a little shelf by the
      platform a red umbrella and a pair of half-worn sandals. With courteous
      gesture he passed from the room.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      |In the grove outside the city wall they paused to rest.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The interpreter, who had come with them from the house and refused to
      leave them till the city gate was reached, had been paid and was returning
      to the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed through the streets, they had been conscious of curious
      whispers, glances from behind opaque windows and rustling from concealed
      doorways and passages beyond&mdash;so a hive of bees despoiled of its comb
      stirs with low-murmured sound and the restless whir of wings.... But no
      one had approached them, no one barred passage to the light oblong box
      that Richard More carried so carefully in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to the grove he glanced at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall rest here,&rdquo; he said with quiet decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she acquiesced&mdash;a little smile coming to her lips as they entered
      the grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green light filtered through the boughs. It touched the twisted trunks
      with a still look of mystery and strangeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; she said under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a place for her to sit down, and as she leaned against the gnarled
      trunk, looking up to the boughs where the filtering light came through, he
      was struck again by the pallor of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I shall signal Kou Ying to bring the
      chairs!&rdquo; He moved to the entrance of the grove&mdash;but she stayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;wait! I like it&mdash;to be alone with you.... Don&rsquo;t call Kou
      Ying&mdash;yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked about with dreamy eyes. &ldquo;It is so beautiful here&mdash;and
      quiet&mdash;I shall rest,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her eyes fell on the box and she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it!&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as his fingers undid the cord and lifted the thin rustling papers and
      drew the coat from its place, she laughed and chatted like a child. And
      her laughter, sounding through the grove, had something sweet and strange
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the coat and laid it before her. She looked down at it. She put
      out her hand and stroked the dragons, the laughter still in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For William Archer,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his sons,&rdquo; responded Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his sons&rsquo; sons forever,&rdquo; she finished dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand still stroked the dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think you&mdash;would get it&mdash;for me!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I should get it&mdash;if you wanted it.... You had only to say
      you wanted it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew that!&rdquo; he added after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew.&rdquo; A little sigh touched her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat a moment in silence. Then he lifted the coat. &ldquo;Put it on,&rdquo; he
      insisted gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her arms to the sleeves and smiled at him as he wrapped it
      about her.... Suddenly the look of pallor was in her face. It grew
      strangely quiet, and a touch of wistfulness curved the smile of the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her, startled... the pallor in the quiet face seemed
      passed to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily he laid down the still figure and ran to the entrance of the
      grove.... At the edge of the path he paused and looked up and motioned&mdash;gesticulating
      swiftly to a single figure on the plateau above.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his post above Kou Ying started. He leaned forward and lifted his
      hand in a swift gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a harsh call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men behind him leaped to their feet and ran from the trees. There was
      confusion and hurry and a swift chatter of voices, as they seized the
      empty sedan chairs and slung them to their shoulders, and moved forward
      toward the winding path that led from the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the edge of the hill before he descended Kou Ying looked down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley below was still. No one moved among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the mountain opposite, the quiet face of the Buddha looked across to
      the plain.

      bent above the deathlike face. A tremor crossed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brushed a hand lightly across her eyes, as if visions fled, and sat
      up. The color came slowly back to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a dream!&rdquo; she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green light of the grove shimmered about her softly and touched her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was William Archer and the coat. But I cannot remember&mdash;&rdquo; She
      passed a hand across her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;We are going to take it home to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand dropped to the dragons and smoothed them absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to his sons&rsquo; sons forever!&rdquo; she murmured happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to the grove, dark incurious faces peered in at the
      blue-robed figure that rested against the gnarled trunk.... The sound of
      quick, indrawn breath passed among the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More lifted her to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed out of the grove where the sedan chairs waited them. The
      bearers prone on their faces on the ground uttered low words that rose in
      a kind of chant and ended in the long indrawn note of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kou Ying alone stood erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to the blue-robed figure and escorted it to the sedan
      chair and seated it with grave care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard More took his place in the chair beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We return by the lower route,&rdquo; said Kou Ying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a sharp word to the bearers. They sprang to their feet and
      touched the handles of the chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep to the lower hill by the spur,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession moved toward the low hill that edged the plain. And as they
      made their way up the long slope at an easy trot Richard More&rsquo;s eyes
      rested on his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat erect beneath the canopy of the chair, the blue robe with its gold
      dragons wrapped about her. Her tranquil face in its white hair looked
      across the plain.... She was more beautiful than he had ever known her! A
      queen in this robe of the Past!
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached his hand till it touched the one that lay on the arm of the
      chair. The face with its tranquil smile turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he saw with a start that the blue of the eyes and the blue of the coat
      were one....
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the spur of the hill and Kou Ying gave the signal to halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind them in the face of the cliff the seated Buddha looked across the
      plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And ahead, far beyond them on the plain, a single figure beneath a red
      umbrella plodded stolidly on, moving toward the tomb of its ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as it went the red umbrella bobbed slowly, a spot of color in the
      distant far-reaching grayness of the plain.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
